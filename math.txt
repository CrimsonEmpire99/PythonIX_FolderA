As we know, a2 – a1 = a3 – a2
2k – 1 – (k + 9) = 2k + 7 – (2k – 1)
2k – 1 – k – 9 = 2k + 7 – 2k + 1
k – 10 = 8 ∴ k = 8 + 10 = 18
ABC is a right angled triangle,
∴ AC2 = BC2 + AB2 …(i)… (Pythagoras theorem
Using distance formula,
AB2 = (5 – 2)2 + (2 + 2)
= 25
BC2 = (2 + 2)2 + (t + 2)2
= 16 + (t + 2)2
AC2 = (5 + 2)2 + (2 – t)2
= 49 + (2 – t)2
Putting values of AB2, AC2 and BC2 in equation (i), we get
49 + (2 – t)2 = 16 + (t + 2)2 + 25
∴ 49 + (2 – t)2 = 41 + (t + 2)2
⇒ (t + 2)2 – (2 – t)2 = 8
⇒ (t2 + 4 + 4t – 4 – t2 + 4t) = 8
8t = 8 ⇒ t = 1
Given vertices of a parallelogram ABCD are:

32.

A(-2, 1), B(a, 0), C(4, b) and D(1, 2)
We know that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
So, midpoint of AC = midpoint of BD
[(-2 + 4)/2, (1 + b)/2] = [(a + 1)/2, (0 + 2)/2]
By equating the corresponding coordinates,

2

2

2

2/2 = (a + 1)/2 and (1 + b)/2 = 2/2
a + 1 = 2 and b + 1 = 2
a = 1 and b = 1
Therefore, a = 1 and b = 1.
Let us find the lengths of sides of a parallelogram, i.e. AB, BC, CD and DA
Using the distance formula,
AB = √[(1 + 2)² + (0 – 1)²] = √(9 + 1) = √10 units
BC = √[(4 – 1)² + (1 – 0)²] = √(9 + 1) = √10 units
And CD = √10 and DA = √10 {the opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and
equal}

33.

34.

Hence, the length of each side of the parallelogram ABCD = √10 units.
Given that the point lies on the x-axis at a distance of 8 units from the y-axis.
That means the point lies in the positive direction of the x-axis, and its y-coordinate is
0.
So, its coordinates are (8, 0).
If the point lies on the y-axis at a distance of –8 units from the x-axis, its x-coordinate
must be 0, and the point lies in the negative direction of the y-axis.
So its coordinates are (0, -8).
Since, P lies nearer to A and is one of the point of trisection.
∴ P divides AB in the ratio 1:2 So, by section formula
P(1×5+2×21+2,1×(−8)+2×11+2)
= P(93,−63) = P(3, – 2)
Since, P lies on 2x – y + k = 0
∴ Coordinates of P must satisfy.
⇒ 2(3) – (-2) + k = 0
⇒ 10 + k = 0
⇒ k = – 10.

(𝐴𝐵)2 =x2+y2-6x-2√3y+12
(𝑂𝐴)2 =(𝑂𝐵)2 and(𝑂𝐵)2 =(𝐴𝐵)2
i.e. x2+y2=12 and x2+y2=x2+y2-6x-2√3y +12
Or, x2+y2=12 and

Now, x +((6-3x)/2) =12

AB = BC
AB2 =BC2
(X-3)2+(Y-4)2 = (X-1)2+(Y+1)2
4X +10Y-23 =0
X =(23-10Y)/4
…….(1)
IN triangle ABC, we have
AB2+BC2 =AC2
(X-3 )2+(Y-4)2 +(X-1)2+(Y+1)2= (3-1)2+(4+1)2
X2+y2- 4X -3Y - 1 = 0
…..(2)
Substituting the value of X from (1) and (2), we get

[(23-10Y)/4]2 + Y2 - (23- 10Y) - 3Y – 1= 0
4Y – 12Y +5 = 0
(2Y -1)(2Y-5) = 0
 Y = ½ OR 5/2
Putting Y = ½ and Y = 5/2 respectively in (1)
we get X = 9/2 and X= -1/2
hence the required vertices of the squares are
( 9/2, 1/2)and (-1/2 , 5/2)

Given the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle ABC are
A(7,2), B(9,10) and C(1,4)
And E and F are the midpoint of AB and AC respectively
Hence the coordinates of E = (7+9/2 , 2+10/2 )
= (16/2 , 12/2 ) = (8,6)
And the coordinates of F =( 7+1/2 , 2+4/2 )
=(8/2 , 6/2) = (4,3)
Now, by the distance formula,
The length of BC = 10 unit
Length of EF = 5 unit
Hence EF = 5 = ½ x10= (½)BC

Let the given points be:

4

10.

A(-2, -5) = (x1, y1)
B(6, 3) = (x2, y2)
The line x – 3y = 0 divides the line segment joining the points A and B in the ratio k :
1.
Using section formula,

4

Point of division P(x, y) = [(kx2 + x1)/(k + 1), (ky2 + y1)/(k + 1)]
x = (6k – 2)/(k + 1) and y = (3k – 5)/(k + 1)
Here, the point of division lies on the line x – 3y = 0.
Thus,
[(6k – 2)/(k + 1)] – 3[(3k – 5)/(k + 1)] = 0
6k – 2 – 3(3k – 5) = 0
6k – 2 – 9k + 15 = 0
-3k + 13 = 0
-3k = -13
k = 13/3
Thus, the ratio in which the line x – 3y = 0 divides the line segment AB is 13 : 3.
Therefore, x = [6(13/3) – 2]/ [(13/3) + 1]
= (78 – 6)/(13 + 3)
= 72/16
= 9/2
And
y = [3(13/3) – 5]/ [(13/3) + 1]
= (39 – 15)/(13 + 3)
= 24/16
= 3/2
Therefore, the coordinates of the point of intersection = (9/2, 3/2).

By given condition, we drawn a figure in which every place are
indicated with his coordinates and direction also. The shape is a
TRAPEZIUM.
We know that, distance between two points (𝑥1 , 𝑦1 ) and (𝑥2 , 𝑦2 )
is given by distance formula:
2

d= √(𝑥2 − 𝑥1 ) +(𝑦2 − 𝑦1 )

2

Now, distance between house and bank = √(5 − 2) +(8 − 4)

2

= √(3)2 +(4)2
= √9 + 16=√25=5

Distance between bank and daughter’s school
= √(13 − 5)2 +(14 − 8)2

2

=√(8) +(6)

√64 + 36=√100=10
Distance between daughter’s school and

office = √(13 − 13) +(26 − 14)
2

=√(0) +(12)

2

= √0 + 144=√144=12
Total distance (House + Bank + School + Office)travelled = 5 + 10 + 12 =
27 km

½+1/2

Distance between house to offices
= √(13 − 2)2 +(26 − 4)2
= √(11)2 +(22)2
= √121 + 484=√605=24.59≈ 24.6 𝑘𝑚
So, extra distance travelled by Ayush in reaching his office =
27 - 24.6 = 2.4km
Hence, the required extra distance travelled by Ayush is 2.4km.

Total distance travelled by Ayush is:
(5+10+12+24.6) km=51.6 km
Cost for 1 km by bus = Rs.5
Cost for 51.6km= Rs. 51.6 x 5 = Rs. 258
Thus, he spend Rs.258 by bus
Cost for 1 km by auto = Rs. 18
Cost for 51.6 km = Rs. 51.6 x 18 =Rs. 928.8
Rs. 928.8 - Rs. 258 = Rs. 670.80
Thus, he saved Rs. 670.80 by not travelling by auto.
Or
The displacement covered by Ayush is 0. (Displacement is the
shortest path covered by the body.)

formula:

=√(3 − 2)2 +(0 − 3)2

= √1 + 9
=√10 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠
d. The triangle formed is an Isosceles triangle.

Given the coordinates of the variables are A(3,0) ,B(4,5) , C(1,4) and D(-2,-1)
Of the quadrilateral ABCD
By the distance formula,
AB = √26
BC = √26
CD = √26
AD = √26
∴ AB= AC =CD =AD =√26
Since all the sides are equal .so, ABCD is a rhombus .
AC and BD are the diagonals of the rhombus ABCD
AC =√32
BD = √72
Area of rhombus = ½ product of two diagonals
=24 sq. units
Given, the line 2x + 3y - 5 = 0 divides the line segment joining
the points (8, -9) and (2, 1)
We have to find the ratio in which the given line divides the line
segment and the coordinates of the point of division.
By section formula,
The coordinates of the point P(x, y) which divides the line
segment joining the points A (x₁ , y₁) and B (x₂ , y₂) internally in
the ratio k : 1 are [(kx₂ + x₁)/k +1, (ky₂ + y₁)/k + 1]
Here, (x₁ , y₁) = (8, -9) and (x₂ , y₂) = (2, 1)
Let the coordinates of the point be (x, y)
[(k(2) + 8)/k + 1, (k(1) + (-9))/k + 1] = (x, y)

1
½+1/2

[(2k + 8)/k + 1, (k - 9)/k + 1] = (x, y) -------------(1)
The point lies on the line 2x + 3y - 5 = 0.
Now, 2((2k + 8)/k + 1) + 3((k - 9)/k + 1) = 5
2(2k + 8) + 3(k - 9) = 5(k + 1)
4k + 16 + 3k - 27 = 5k + 5
By grouping,
4k + 3k - 5k = 5 + 27 - 16
7k - 5k = 5 + 11
2k = 16
k = 16/2
k=8
Therefore, the point divides the line segment in the ratio 8 : 1.
To find the coordinates of the point of division,
Put k = 8 in (1)
(x, y) = [(2(8) + 8)/8 + 1, (8 - 9)/8 + 1]
(x, y) = [(16 + 8)/9, -1/9]
(x, y) = [24/9, -1/9]
(x, y) = [8/3, -1/9]
Therefore, the coordinates of the point of division are 8/3 and 1/9.

Consider the house is at origin (0, 0), then coordinates of grocery store, electrician's

5

shop, food cart and bus stand are respectively (2, 3), (-4, -6), (6, - 8) and (-6, 8)
(i) (d): Since, grocery store is at (2, 3) and food cart is at (6, -8)
∴
Required distance =(6−2)2+(−8−3)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
=42+112−−−−−−−√=16+121−−−−−−−√=137−−−√ cm
(ii) (b): Required distance
=(−6)2+82−−−−−−−−−√=36+64−−−−−−√=100−−−√=10 cm
(iii) (c) : Let 0divides EG in the ratio k : I ,then
0=2k−4k+1⇒2k=4⇒k=2
Thus, 0 divides EG in the ratio 2 : 1
Hence, required ratio = OG :OE i.e., 1 : 2
(iv) (c): Since, (0, 0) is the mid-point of (-6,8) and (6, -8), therefore both bus stand and
food cart are at equal distances from the house. Hence, required ratio is 1 : 1.
(v) (d): Mid-point of grocery store and electrician's shop is (2−42,3−62), i.e., (−1,−32)
Thus, the diagonals does not bisect each other [∵
Mid-point are not same]

12.

(i) (c): Required coordinates are (0,43)
(ii) (c)
(iii) (a): Radius = Distance between (0,0) and (43,0)
=(43)2+02−−−−−−−−√=43 units
(iv) (b): Area of circle = π
(radius)2
=π(43)2=169π sq. units
(v) (d): Let the coordinates of the other end be (x,y).
Then (0,0) will be the mid-point of (1,7√3)
and (x, y).
∴(1+x2,7√3+y2)=(0,0)
⇒1+x2=0 and 7√3+y2=0
⇒x=−1 and y=−7√3

Let the angles of a triangle △ABC be (a – d), a, (a+ d) respectively which
constitute an A.P. As we know that sum of all the three angles of a triangle is
180˚.

So, (a – d) + a+ (a+ d) = 180˚

⇒ a = 60˚
therefor ∠B = 60˚
Hence, SinB = √3 /2

HINT: ∵ x/a = sec θ cosφ, y/b = sec θ sinφ and z/ c = tan θ,
Then find (x/a )2 + (y/b )2 – (z/ c)2
‫ ؞‬x2 / a2 + y2/b2 = 1 + z2/c2
We have
sin A + sin 2 A = 1
⇒ sin A = 1 – sin2 A
⇒ sin A = cos2 A
Squaring both sides
⇒sin2A = cos4A

......(i)

......(ii)

From equations (i) and (ii), we have
cos2A + cos4A = sin A + sin2A = 1

98.

We know that, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1

Taking cube on both sides,
⇒ (sin2θ + cos2θ)3 = 1
⇒ (sin2θ)3 + (cos2θ)3 + 3 sin2θ cos2θ (sin2θ + cos2θ) = 1
⇒ sin6θ + cos6θ + 3 sin2θ cos2θ = 1

99.

Given
x = a cos θ and y = b sin θ,
‫ ؞‬b2x2 + a2y2
= b2( a Cosθ )2 + a2(b Sinθ)2
= a2b2(cos2θ + sin2θ)

Using Pythagoras theorem,

sin A = BC/AC = 7/25, cos A = AB/AC = 24/25
Since we know,

2

tan 45° = 1
cos 30° = √3/2
sin 60° = √3/2
Therefore, putting these values in the given equation:
2(1)2 + (√3/2)2 – (√3/2)2

We know that sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
Therefore, (sin2θ + cos2θ)3 = 1
or, (sin2θ)3 + (cos2θ)3+ 3sin2θ cos2θ (sin2θ + cos2θ) = 1
or, sin6θ + cos6θ + 3sin2θ cos2θ = 1
We know that :
cosec²θ - cot²θ = 1
Let us factorize the given expression :

2

2

( cosec θ + cot θ )( cosec θ - cot θ ) = 1
We are given that cosec θ + cot θ = x
Hence :
x ( cosec θ - cot θ ) = 1
= > cosec θ - cot θ = 1/x

39.

Thus the required value is 1/x
Now, we know the trigonometric ratios,

2

cos A = AC/AB
cos B = BC/AB
Since, it is given,
cos A = cos B
AC/AB = BC/AB
AC = BC
We know that by isosceles triangle theorem, the angles opposite to the equal
sides are equal.
Therefore, ∠A = ∠B

or, sin6 θ + cos6 θ + 3sin2 θ cos2 θ = 1
Solution : L.H.S. = (sin4 θ – cos4 θ +1) cosec2 θ
= [(sin2 θ – cos2 θ) (sin2 θ + cos2 θ) + 1] cosec2 θ
= (sin2 θ – cos2 θ + 1) cosec2 θ

A and (4A-600) are acute angles.
Therefore, by using complementary rule:
tan A = cot (4A-600)
tan A = tan {900-(4A-600)}
tan A = tan {900-4A+600}
A = 1500-4A → 5A = 1500 → A = 300

Therefore, sec 300= and Cosec300= 2

If sec θ - sec² θ = -1,
Then, sec θ = sec² θ -1 → sec θ = tan2 θ.
Now, tan² θ - tan4 θ → sec θ – (sec θ)2.
sec θ - sec² θ = -1
If sin θ – cos θ = 0
Then, (sin θ – cos θ) = 0
(sin θ – cos θ)2 = (0)2 → sin2 θ –2sin θ cos θ + cos2 θ = 0
(sin2 θ + cos2 θ) –2sin θ cos θ → 1 – sin 2θ = 0 { sin2 θ + cos2 θ=1 &

Let θ be the angle for which sinθ/cosθ = 8/15

Consider a right triangle ABC, with angle B = 90 and angle ACB = θ
tanθ = AB/BC = 8/15
AB = 8k, BC = 15k
By applying Pythagoras theorem, we will get AC = 17k
Thus sinθ = AB/AC = 8k/17k = 8/17
Cosθ = BC/AC = 15K/17K = 15/17
k + 1 = sec 2 𝜃 (1 + sin 𝜃) (1- sin 𝜃)

Solution :
Given : tan (A + B) = √3 = tan600
A + B = 600 ----------(1)
And tan (A – B) = 1/ √3 = tan300
A – B = 300 --------(2)
By adding eq. 1 and 2, we get
2A = 900
A = 450
Therefore B = 600 - 450 = 150

We have, given tan𝜃 + sin 𝜃 = m and tan 𝜃– sin 𝜃 = n , then
LHS = (m2- n2)=(tan𝜃+ sin 𝜃)2 –( tan𝜃-sin 𝜃)2
= tan2𝜃 + sin2𝜃 +2tan𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 – tan2𝜃 - sin2𝜃 + 2𝑡𝑎𝑛𝜃 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃

Proved.

We have. xsin3θ + ycos3θ = sinθ cosθ
⇒ (xsinθ)sin2θ + (ycosθ)cos2θ = sinθ cosθ
⇒ (xsinθ)sin2θ + (xsinθ)cos2θ = sinθ cosθ (since, xsinθ = ycosθ)
⇒ xsinθ(sin2θ +cos2θ) = sinθ cosθ
⇒ xsinθ = sinθ cosθ
⇒ x = cosθ
We have. xsinθ = ycosθ
cosθ.sinθ = ycosθ (∵ x = cosθ)
⇒ y = sinθ
Hence , 𝑥 2 + 𝑦 2 = cos2θ+ sin2θ =1 proved.
∵ 𝑥 = 𝑟cos 𝜃sin 𝜙
𝑦 = 𝑟sin 𝜃sin 𝜙
𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑧 = rcos 𝜙
On squaring all, we get
⇒ 𝑥 2 = 𝑟 2 cos2 𝜃sin2 𝜙 … (i)
𝑦 2 = 𝑟 2 sin2 𝜃 sin2 𝜙 … (ii)
𝑧 2 = 𝑟 2 cos2 𝜙 … (iii)
Adding (i), (ii) and (iii), we get
𝑥 2 + 𝑦 2 + 𝑧 2 = 𝑟 2 cos2 𝜃 sin2 𝜙 + 𝑟 2 sin2 𝜃 sin2 𝜙 + 𝑟 2 cos2 𝜙
= 𝑟 2 sin2 𝜙(cos2 𝜃 + sin2 𝜃) + 𝑟 2 cos2 𝜙
= 𝑟 2 sin2 𝜙 ⋅ 1 + 𝑟 2 cos 2 𝜙
= 𝑟 2 (sin2 𝜙 + cos 2 𝜙) = 𝑟 2 . 1 = 𝑟 2

dividing equation a sin2x+b cos 2x = c
by cos2 x
a tan2 x+ b =c sec2 x
⇒ a tan2 x +b =c(1+ tan2 x)
⇒ a tan2 x + b = c + c tan2 x
= tan2x(a – c) = c - b
c−b
tan2 x = a – c
Similarly , dividing equation b sin2 y+a cos2 y =d
by cos2 y
b tan2 y+ a=d sec2 y
⇒b tan2 y +a=d(1+ tan2 y)
⇒b tan2y + a = d +d tan2 y

Consider θ is the angle of elevation of the Sun.

In right triangle ABC,
tan θ = AB/BC = h/√3h = 1/√3

Let AB be the wall, AC be the length of the ladder.

Let AB be h m and BC be x m. From the question, DC is 40 m longer than
BC.
So, BD = (40 + x) m
And two right triangles ABC and ABD are formed as shown in the figure.

In ΔABC,
tan 60° = AB/ BC
√3 = h/x
x = h/√3….(i)
In ΔABD,
tan 30° = AB/ BD
1/ √3 = h/ (x + 40)
x + 40 = √3h
h/√3 + 40 = √3h [using (i)]
h + 40√3 = 3h

Height of balloon above the girl
height = 88.2 m – 1.2 m = 87 m.
To Find: Distance travelled by the

Let us redesign the given figure as
per our convenient
Step 1: In right ΔBEC,
tan 30° = BE/CE
1/√3= 87/CE
CE = 87√3
Step 2:
In right ΔADC,
tan 60° = AD/CD
√3= 87/CD
CD = 87/√3 = 29√3
Step 3:
DE = CE – CD = (87√3 – 29√3) = 29√3(3 – 1) = 58√3
Distance travelled by the balloon = 58√3 m.

𝐴𝐵

𝐴𝐵

Then 𝐵𝐶 = √3 : 1 ⇒ 𝐵𝐶 = tan600 ⇒ ∠𝐶 = 600
So ∠A = 900 − 600 = 300
Therefore the angle at which the plane touched down is 600 and the angle it made with
the altitude while descending is 300.

AB = AD + DB = 6 m (given)
⇒ 2.54 m + DB = 6 m
⇒ DB = 3.46 m
Now, in the right ∠d ABCD.

9.

Thus, the length of the ladder CD is 4 m.
Let A be the flood light of height 60 m above the ground.
Thus, AB = 60 m
Also, AC is the length of the wire cable.
Angle of inclination = ∠ACB = 60
In right triangle ABC,
sin 60° = AB/AC
√3/2 = 60/AC
AC = (60 × 2)√/3
= (120 × √3)/(√3 × √3)

Therefore, the length of the cable is 40√3 m.

ANSWERS:
Q. NO
1.

ANSWER
Let AB and CD be the two poles of equal
height and their heights be h m. BC be the
80 m wide road. P be any point on the road.
Let CP be x m, therefore BP = (80 – x) .
Also, ∠APB = 60° and ∠DPC = 30°
In right angled triangle DCP,
tan30°=CD/CP ⇒h/x=1/√3
⇒h =x/√3−−−−−−−−−−(1)
In right angled triangle ABP,
tan60°=AB/AP⇒h/(80–x)=√3
⇒h=√3(80–x)--------------------- (2)
From equation (1) and (2)
⇒x/√3=√3(80–x)⇒x=3(80–x)⇒x=240–3x⇒x+3x=240⇒4x=240⇒x=60
Height of the pole, h=x/√3=60/√3=20√3.
Thus, position of the point P is 60 m from C and height of each pole is 20√3 m.

Given,

AB is the height of the chimney.
DC = 20 m (given)
In right ΔABD,
tan 30° = AB/BD
1/√3 = AB/(20 + BC)
AB = (20 + BC)/√3….(i)
In right ΔABC,

tan 60° = AB/BC
√3 = AB/BC
AB = √3 BC….(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
√3 BC = (20 + BC)/√3
3 BC = 20 + BC
2 BC = 20
BC = 10
Substituting the value of BC in equation (ii),
AB = (20 + 10)/√3 = 30/√3 = 10√3

6.

Therefore, the height of the chimney is 10√3 m, and the width of the building is 10 m.
Using given instructions, draw a figure. Let AC be the broken part of the advertising
pole. Angel C = 30 degrees.
BC = 8 m
To Find: Height of the pole, which is AB
From figure: Total height of the pole is the sum of AB and AC i.e. AB+AC
In right ΔABC,
Using cosine and tangent of angles,
cos 30° = BC/AC
We know that, cos 30° = √3/2
√3/2 = 8/AC
AC = 16/√3 …(1)
Also,
tan 30° = AB/BC
1/√3 = AB/8
AB = 8/√3 ….(2)
From (1) and (2),
Total height of the advertising tower = AB + AC = 16/√3 + 8/√3 = 24/√3 = 8√3 m.

A lighthouse is a tall tower with light near the top. These are often built on islands, coasts or
on cliffs. Lighthouses on water surface act as a navigational aid to the mariners and send
warning to boats and ships for dangers. Initially wood, coal would be used as illuminators.
Gradually it was replaced by candles, lanterns, electric lights. Nowadays they are run by
machines and remote monitoring. Prongs Reef lighthouse of Mumbai was constructed in
1874-75. It is approximately 40 meters high and its beam can be seen at a distance of 30
kilometres. A ship and a boat are coming towards the lighthouse from opposite directions.

ANSWERS:
Q. NO
1.

ANSWER
Let the boy initially stand at point Y with inclination 30° and then he
approaches the building to the point X with inclination 60°.

To Find: The distance boy walked towards the building i.e. XY
From figure,
XY = CD.
Height of the building = AZ = 30 m.
AB = AZ – BZ = 30 – 1.5 = 28.5
Measure of AB is 28.5 m
In right ΔABD,
tan 30° = AB/BD
1/√3 = 28.5/BD
BD = 28.5√3 m
Again,

MARKS

In right ΔABC,
tan 60° = AB/BC
√3 = 28.5/BC
BC = 28.5/√3 = 28.5√3/3
Therefore, the length of BC is 28.5√3/3 m.
XY = CD = BD – BC = (28.5√3-28.5√3/3) = 28.5√3(1-1/3) = 28.5√3 × 2/3 =
57/√3 = 19√3 m.
Thus, the distance boy walked towards the building is 19√3 m.

Let AB be the wall and BC be the length of its shadow when the sun’s altitude (angle
of elevation from the top of the wall to the tip of the shadow) is 60° and DB be the
length of the shadow when the angle of elevation is 30°.
Let us assume, AB = h m, BC = x m

5

DB = (40 +x) m
In the right triangle ABC,
tan 60° = AB/BC
√3 = h/x
h = √3 x……….(i)
In the right triangle ABD,
tan 30° = AB/BD
1/√3 =h/(x + 40) ……..(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
x(√3 )(√3 ) = x + 40
3x = x + 40
2x = 40
x = 20
Substituting x = 20 in (i),
h = 20√3

6.

Hence, the height of the wall is 20√3 m.
Let AB be the height of the watch tower and CE be the height of the mobile network
5
tower.
Also, let A be the point from where the angle of elevation of the mobile network tower
is 60° and the angle of depression of its foot is 45°.
EC = DE + CD
From the figure,
CD = AB = 7 m
BC = AD
In right ΔABC,
tan 45° = AB/BC
1 = 7/BC
BC = 7 {since BC = AD}
Thus, AD = 7 m

In right triangle ADE,
tan 60° = DE/AD
√3 = DE/7
⇒ DE = 7√3 m
EC = DE + CD = (7√3 + 7) = 7(√3 + 1)
Therefore, the height of the mobile network tower is 7(√3 + 1) m.

Also, PB = PD
∴PA – PB = PC – PD
⇒ AB = CD

First, draw a triangle ABC and then two circles having a diameter as AB and AC
respectively.
To prove that D lies on BC and BDC is a straight line.
As angle in the semi-circle are equal
So, ∠ADB = ∠ADC = 90°
Hence, ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180°
∴ ∠BDC is a straight line.
So D lies on the line BC.

4.

OP is the radius of the circle to the tangent PT
OQ is the radius to the tangent TQ.
So, OP ⊥ PT and TQ ⊥ OQ
∴ ∠OPT = ∠OQT = 90°
So, ∠PTQ+∠POQ+∠OPT+∠OQT = 360° (sum
the interior angles of quadrilateral)
∠PTQ +90°+110°+90° = 360°
∠PTQ = 70°
So The angle between two paths should be 70°

AB and CD are tangents to the inner circle.
OM = ON (Radius of the inner circle)
Thus, AB and CD are two chords of the outer circle which are equidistant
from the centre.
Therefore, AB = CD
24.

OA = 13cm
AC = 24cm

In △ABO,
AB = 12 cm (Perpendicular from centre bisects the
chord)
∠ABO = 90ᵒ
Therefore,
AO2 = AB2 + OB2
169 = 144 + OB2
OB2 = 25
OB = 5 cm

OP² = OQ² + PQ²
169 = 25 + PQ²
PQ² = 144
PQ = 12
Area PQOR = ar (AOPQ) + ar (AOPR)
= 12 × 12 × 5 + 12 × 12 × 5 = 60 cm²
Let radius of circle = R
∴ πR² = 25π
⇒ R = 5 cm
∴ Distance between two parallel tangents = diameter = 2 × 5 = 10 cm.
Given ∠APB = 60°
∵ ∠APB + ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 180°
⇒ APB + x + x = 180°
[∵ PA = PB ∴ ∠PAB = ∠PBA = x ]
⇒ 60° + 2x = 180°
⇒ 2x = 180° – 60°
⇒ 2x = 120°
⇒ x = 120°/2 = 60°
Also, ∠OAP = 90°
⇒ ∠OAB + ∠PAB = 90°

∠𝑂𝐴𝑃 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝑂𝐵𝑃 = 90°
In quadrilateral OAPB,
∠𝐴𝐵𝑃 + ∠𝑂𝐴𝑃 + ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 + ∠𝑂𝐵𝑃 = 360°

∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 = 360 − 215 = 145°
In quadrilateral POQT,
∠PTQ + ∠TPO + ∠TQO + ∠POQ
= 360°
⇒ ∠PTQ + 90° + 90° + 110° = 360°
⇒ ∠PTQ + 290° = 360°
⇒ ∠PTQ = 360° – 290° = 70°
Sol:- Join S to A and B to T. Then AS = 6 cm and BT = 4 cm.

In ∆PSA, by using Pythagoras theorem, in ∆𝑃𝑆𝐴 , find the length PA = 10 cm
Similarly In ∆BQT, BQ = 5 cm.
Therefore, PQ = PA + AK + BK + BQ = 10 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 25 cm
For ΔOSR,
∠𝑂𝑅𝑆 = 30𝑜 (Since, Tangent is ⊥ the radius)
OS = OR [radii of same circle]
∠OSR = ∠SRO = 30∘ [angles opposite to equal sides are equal]
Similarly, ∠OSQ = 40∘
For ΔOSQ,
OS = OQ [radii of same circle]

∠SQO = ∠OSQ = 40∘ [angles opposite to equal sides are equal]
∴∠QSR = ∠OSR + ∠OSQ
=30∘+40∘
=70∘
So, Answer of Rohit is false.
Here. BP = BQ = 25 cm, Therefore, CQ = CR = 38 – 25 = 13 cm.
Then DR = 28 – 13 = 15 cm.

∠AOP = 180o − ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 = 65o.

Given: PQ is a diameter of a circle with centre O.
The lines AB and CD are the tangents at P and Q respectively.
To Prove: AB‖‖ CD
Proof: Since AB is a tangent to the circle at P and OP is the radius through the point of
contact.
∠OPA =90°……….(i)
[The tangent at any point of a circle is⟂
to the radius through the point of contact]
CD is a tangent to the circle at Q and OQ is the radius through the point of contact.
∠OQD =90°……….(ii)
[The tangent at any point of a circle is⟂
to the radius through the point of contact]
From eq. (i) and (ii),
∠OPA =∠OQD
But these form a pair of equal alternate angles also,
AB ‖CD
43.

2

We know that the tangent at any point of a circle is⟂to the radius through the point
of contact.
∠OPA =90°
𝑂𝐴2 = 𝑂𝑃2 + 𝐴𝑃2 [By Pythagoras theorem]
⟹52 = 𝑂𝑃2 + 42
⟹25=𝑂𝑃2 +16
⟹𝑂𝑃2 = 9
⟹OP = 3 cm
44.

2

We know that the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal.
AP = AS ……….(i)
BP = BQ ……….(ii)
CR = CQ ……….(iii)
DR = DS ……….(iv)

On adding eq. (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), we get
(AP + BP) + (CR + DR) = (AS + BQ) + (CQ + DS)
⟹AB + CD = (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
⟹AB + CD = AD + BC

Draw two concentric circles with the centre O. Now, draw a chord AB in the larger
circle, which touches the smaller circle at a point P, as shown in the figure below.

2

From the above diagram, AB is tangent to the smaller circle to point P.
∴ OP ⊥ AB
Using Pythagoras’ theorem in triangle OPA,
OA2= AP2+OP2
52 = AP2+32
AP2 = 25-9
AP = 4
Now, as OP ⊥ AB,
Since the perpendicular from the centre of the circle bisects the chord, AP will be
equal to PB.
So, AB = 2AP = 2×4 = 8 cm
So, the length of the chord of the larger circle is 8 cm.
46.

First, draw a perpendicular from the centre O of the triangle to a point P on the circle,
which is touching the tangent. This line will be perpendicular to the tangent of the

circle.
So, OP is perpendicular to PQ, i.e., OP ⊥ PQ

2

From the above figure, it is also seen that △OPQ is a right-angled triangle.
It is given that
OQ = 25 cm and PQ = 24 cm
By using Pythagoras’ theorem in △OPQ,
OQ2 = OP2 +PQ2
(25)2 = OP2+(24)2
OP2 = 625-576
OP2 = 49
OP = 7 cm
Hence 7 cm, is the radius of the given circle.
47.

First, draw a circle and connect two points, A and B, such that AB becomes the
diameter of the circle. Now, draw two tangents, PQ and RS, at points A and B,

2

respectively.
Now, both radii, i.e. AO and OB, are perpendicular to the tangents.
So, OB is perpendicular to RS, and OA is perpendicular to PQ.
So, ∠OAP = ∠OAQ = ∠OBR = ∠OBS = 90°
From the above figure, angles OBR and OAQ are alternate interior angles.
Also, ∠OBR = ∠OAQ and ∠OBS = ∠OAP (Since they are also alternate interior
angles)
So, it can be said that line PQ and line RS will be parallel to each other (Hence
Proved).
48.

Since, the length of tangents drawn from an external point of a circle are equal.

∴ PA = PB, CA = CQ and DB = DQNow, perimeter of ∆PCD = PC + CD + DP
= PC + (CQ + QD) + DP
= PC + (CA + DB) + PD [∵ CQ = CA and DQ = DB]
= (PC + CA) + (PD + DB)
= PA + PB
= PA + PA [∵ PB = PA]
= 2 PA = 2 × 20 = 40 units.
Hence, the perimeter of ∆PCD is 40 units.

From the given figure

∠QPT = 60°
∠OPT = 90°
Thus, ∠OPQ = ∠OQP = 30°, i.e., ∠POQ = 120°.
Also, ∠PRQ = (1/2) reflex ∠POQ
reflex ∠POQ = 360° – 120° = 240°
Therefore, ∠PRQ = (1/2) × 240° = 120°

Given: O is centre of the circle, PQ is chord and PT is tangent at P.

To find: ∠TPQ
Solution: In ∆OPQ
∠POQ + ∠OPQ + ∠OQP = 180°
⇒ 70° + ∠OPQ + ∠OPQ = 180°
(∵ OP = OQ, radii of the circle)
⇒ 70° + 2∠OPQ = 180°
⇒ 2∠OPQ = 110°
⇒ ∠OPQ = 55°
OP is perpendicular to the tangent at P.
∴ ∠OPT = 90°
⇒ ∠OPQ + ∠TPQ = 90°
⇒ 55° + ∠TPQ = 90°
⇒ ∠TPQ = 90° – 55°
∠TPQ = 35°

adding (i) and (ii) we get

⇒ AB = AR + BN
adding (iii) and (iv) we get

BM =

⇒ CD = CN + DP
adding (v) and (vi) we get
EQ + FQ = EP + FR
⇒ EF = EP + FR
Adding all these we obtain
AB + CD + EF = AR + ( BN + CN ) + (DP + EP) + FR = BC + DE + FA
∴ AB + CD + EF = BC + DE + FA

20.
Here, EA = EC and EB = ED (Tangents drawn from an exterior point are equal)
On adding EA + EB = EC + ED => AB = CD.

PR2 = PQ2 + QR2 = 122 + 52
therefore, PR = 13 cm
𝑃(𝑃𝑄𝑅) = 5+12+13 = 30

Now, ar(∆PQR) = 2 × 𝑃(𝑃𝑄𝑅) × 𝑟

∠APB=180°-150°=30°
∠AOB=180°-40∠BAO =140°
Let ∠BAO=x then,
x+x+140°=180

or, x= 20°
24.(i) In triangle OAC, ∠OCA = 90°
[Since, radius at the point of contact is perpendicular to tangent]
∠OAC + ∠AOC = 90° = x + y = 90°
(ii) In quadrilateral OQPR, ∠ROQ + ∠RPQ = 180°
[ Angle between the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is supplementary to

the angle subtended by the line segment joining the point of contact at the centre]
= ∠ROQ = 180° - 30° = 150°
(iii)Here ∠ABC=90°(Angle in semicircle)
So in triangle ABC , ∠BAC=180°-90°-55°=35°
Also ∠OAT=90°
∠BAT+ ∠OAB=90°
Or, ∠BAT=90°-35°=55°

Given: ABCD is a parallelogram circumscribing a circle.
To Prove: ABCD is a rhombus.
Proof: Since, the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal.
AP = AS ……….(i)
BP = BQ ……….(ii)
CR = CQ ……….(iii)
DR = DS ……….(iv)
On adding eq. (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), we get
(AP + BP) + (CR + DR) = (AS + BQ) + (CQ + DS)
⟹AB + CD = (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
⟹AB + CD = AD + BC
⟹AB + AB = AD + AD [Opposite sides of gm are equal]
⟹2AB = 2AD
⟹AB = AD
But AB = CD and AD = BC [Opposite sides of gm]
⸫AB = BC = CD = AD
⸫Parallelogram ABCD is a rhombus

∵PQ is the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle at the point L.
Since PQ is tangent at the point L to the smaller circle with centre O.
⸫OL⫠PQ
∵PQ is a chord of the bigger circle and OL⫠PQ
⸫ OL bisects PQ
⸫PQ=2PL
In ΔOPL,

=√25 − 9 =4

⸫Chord PQ = 2PL =8 cm
⸫Length of chord PQ = 8 cm

Let the circle touch the sides AB, BC, CD and DA at the points P, Q, R, and S respectively.
Join OP, OQ, OR and OS.
Join OA, OB, OC and OD.
Since the two tangents drawn from an external point subtend equal angles at the centre.
∠1=∠2, ∠3=∠4, ∠5=∠6, ∠7=∠8
But ∠1+∠2+∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8=360°
(∵sum of all angles around a point=360°)
⸫2[∠2+∠3+∠6+∠7]=360°
And 2(∠4+∠5+∠8+∠1)=360c
⟹(∠2+∠3)+(∠6+∠7)=180°
And (∠4+∠5)+(∠8+∠1)=180°
⟹∠AOB+∠COD=180° and ∠BOC+∠AOD=180°
28.

Let ∠APB = θ.
Now, by using the theorem “the lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are
equal”, we can say PA = PB. So, PAB is an isosceles triangle.
Thus,
∠PAB = ∠PBA = ½ (180°− θ ) = 90° – (½) θ
By using the theorem, “the tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through
the point of contact”, we can say ∠OAP = 90°
Therefore,
∠OAB = ∠OAP – ∠PAB = 90° – [90° – (½) θ]
∠OAB = (½)θ
∠OAB = (½) ∠APB
⇒∠APB = 2 ∠OAB.
Hence proved.

From the figure given, join OC. Now, the diagram will be as29.

Now the triangles △OPA and △OCA are similar using SSS congruency as:
(i) OP = OC They are the radii of the same circle
(ii) AO = AO It is the common side
(iii) AP = AC These are the tangents from point A
So, △OPA ≅△OCA
Similarly,
△OQB ≅△OCB
So,
∠POA = ∠COA … (Equation i)
And, ∠QOB = ∠COB … (Equation ii)
Since the line POQ is a straight line, it can be considered as a diameter of the circle.
So, ∠POA +∠COA +∠COB +∠QOB = 180°
Now, from equations (i) and equation (ii) we get,
2∠COA+2∠COB = 180°
∠COA+∠COB = 90°
∴∠AOB = 90°
Consider a parallelogram ABCD which is circumscribing a circle with a center O. Now, since
30.
ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD and BC = AD.

3

From the above figure, it is seen that,
(i) DR = DS
(ii) BP = BQ
(iii) CR = CQ
(iv) AP = AS
These are the tangents to the circle at D, B, C, and A, respectively.
Adding all these we get,
DR+BP+CR+AP = DS+BQ+CQ+AS
By rearranging them we get,
(BP+AP)+(DR+CR) = (CQ+BQ)+(DS+AS)
Again by rearranging them we get,
AB+CD = BC+AD
Now, since AB = CD and BC = AD, the above equation becomes
2AB = 2BC
∴ AB = BC
Since AB = BC = CD = DA, it can be said that ABCD is a rhombus.
PS = PQ + QS = 8 => PQ + QM = 8 cm
31.
PT = PS = 8 cm => PT = PR + RT = 8 cm => PR + RM = 8 cm
Perimeter of ΔPQR = PQ + QR + RP = (PQ + QM) + (MR + RP)
= 8 + 8 cm
= 16 cm
Given: AB is a tangent to the circle with centre O.
32.
To Prove: Angle BPQ = Angle PRQ
Angle RPQ = ?
Proof: Angle PQR = 900 [Angle in a Semi – circle]

In ΔPQR, Angle QPR + Angle PRQ = 900 → (i)
And, Angle OPB = 900
 Angle RPB = 900
 Angle QPR + Angle QPB = 900 → (ii)
From (i) and (ii), Angle QPB = Angle PRQ
 Angle BPQ = Angle PRQ → (iii)
In ΔPQR, Angle PQR = 900
Angle PRQ = Angle QPB = 600
Then Angle RPQ = 1800 – (900 + 600) = 300
 Angle RPQ = 300
We know that the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
33.
So, AP = AS → (i)
BP = BQ → (ii)
CR = CQ → (iii)
DR = DS → (iv)
Adding the above equations,
(AP + BP) + (CR + DR) = (AS + BQ + CQ + DS)
 AB + CD = (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
 AB + CD = AD + BC

QUESTION
MARK
When a person is riding a bicycle, he applies some force on the pedals due to which the chain 4
over the pulley attached to the pedals starts to rotate. Ultimately the wheel rotates and the
bicycle
covers
a
certain
path.
As the wheels rotate on their axis, they perform a rotational motion. Due to this rotation with
the contact of the ground the bicycle covers a certain longitudinal distance. So, the wheels
also perform a translational motion concerning the ground. The bicycle is dragged by a path
due to the rotational motion performed by the wheels of the bicycle.
In a moving bicycle all the spokes of a wheel are along its radii.
(i)
What is the angle between
spokes of the wheel
and its movement on the
ground at the point of
contact.

As the roundabout is a circle and the shape obtained is a parallelogram circumscribing
the circle it will be a rhombus. The situation can geometrically be represented by the
figure
As the length of any two tangents which are drawn from the same point to the circle is
equal
DR = DS
BP = BQ
CR = CQ
AP = AS
These are the tangents to the circle at D, B, C, and
A, respectively.
Adding all these, we get
DR+BP+CR+AP = DS+BQ+CQ+AS
or, (BP+AP)+(DR+CR) = (CQ+BQ)+(DS+AS)
or, AB+CD = BC+AD
or, 2AB = 2BC (since AB = CD and BC = AD
∴ AB = BC
Since AB = BC = CD = DA, it can be said that ABCD is a rhombus.

ANSWERS:
Q. NO
1.

ANSWER
Consider the triangle ABC,
We know that the length of any two tangents which are drawn from the same point to
the circle is equal.
So,
CF = CD = 6 cm
BE = BD = 8 cm
AE = AF = x
Now, it can be observed that
AB = EB+AE = 8+x
CA = CF+FA = 6+x
BC = DC+BD = 6+8 = 14
As semi-perimeter “s”
2s = AB+CA+BC
By putting the respective values, we get,
2s = 28+2x
s = 14+x

MARKS

2.

Either x+14=0 or x-7 =0
i.e., x= -14 (not possible) or x= 7
So, AB = x+8 = 7+ 8 =15 cm
CA = 6+x = 6+7 = 13cm
The required figure for the problem
situation is represented by the fig.
Join OC. As OC is the radius.
Since, tangent at any point of a circle
is perpendicular to the radius through
the point of contact.
∴ OC ⊥ PC
Now, ∠PCA = 110° [Given]
⇒ ∠PCO + ∠OCA = 110°
⇒ 90° + ∠OCA = 110°
⇒ ∠OCA = 20°
∵ OC = OA = radius of circle

∴ ∠OCA = ∠OAC = 20°
[Sides opposite to equal angles are equal]
⇒ 50° + 20° + ∠PBC = 180°
⇒ ∠PBC = 180° – 70°
⇒ ∠PBC = 110°
Since, ABP is a straight line.
∴ ∠PBC + ∠CBA = 180°
⇒ ∠CBA = 180° – 110° = 70°
Since, PC is a tangent,
∠BCP = ∠CAB = 20° [Angles in alternate segment]
In ∆PAC,
∠P + ∠C + ∠A = 180°
∠P = 180° – (∠C + ∠A)
= 180°-(110°+ 20°)
= 180° – 130° = 50°
In ∆PBC,
∠BPC + ∠PCB + ∠CBP = 180°
⇒ 50° + 20° + ∠PBC = 180°
⇒ ∠PBC = 180° – 70°
⇒ ∠PBC = 110°
Since, ABP is a straight line.
∴ ∠PBC + ∠CBA = 180°
⇒ ∠CBA = 180° – 110°
= 70°

CD and EF are two C parallel tangents at points A and B of a circle with centre O.

To prove: AB passes through centre O or AOB is diameter of the circle.
Const.: Join OA and OB. Draw OM || CD.
Proof: ∠1 = 90° … (i)
…[∵ Tangent is I to the radius through the point of contact
OM || CD
∴ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180° …(Co-interior angles
90° + ∠2 = 180° …[From (i)
∠2 = 180° – 90o = 90°
Similarly, ∠3 = 90°
∠2 + ∠3 = 90° + 90° = 180°
∴ AOB is a straight line.
Hence AOB is a diameter of the circle with centre O.
∴ AB passes through centre 0.

Join OP.
In △APO and △BPO
OA = OB ( radius )

OAP = OBP (each 90ᵒ)
OP = OP (common)
△APO ≅ △BPO
PA = PB (CPCT)
PR + RC = PQ + CQ

10.

PA = PB (tangents from external point)
PR + RA = PQ + QB
PR + RC = PQ + CQ (because RA = RC and BQ = CQ)
In △PQR, PQ = 6 cm, QR = 8cm and PR = 4 cm.

Let the radius of circles with centre P, Q and R be x, y and z respectively.
Therefore,

Now, AB + BC + AC = 7 + 4 + 9 = 20 cm
⇒AB + BD + CD + AC = 20 cm
⇒ AP + AQ = 20 cm
⇒ 2AP = 20 cm ⇒AP = 10 cm

(ii) Here ∠OAP = 90°
In ΔAOP and ΔBOP,
∠OAP = ∠OBP [90° each]
OA = OB [radii of circle]
PA = PB
[tangents drawn from an external point are equal]
∴ ΔAOP ~ΔBOP [by SAS similarity]
∴ ∠APO = ∠OPB [by CPCT]
= 50°
∴ ∠BPA = 50° + 50° = 100°
13.

In the ∆ PQR, QP = QR (Tangents drawn from an external point are equal)
Therefore, ∠QPR = ∠QRP (Opposite angles of equal sides)
Now, by using angle sum property of a triangle,
∠QPR = ∠QRP = 60o.
Therefore, ∆ PQR is an equilateral triangle.
Now, Join Q to O and also O to P.

Now, find ∠OPS = 30o.

Therefore, PS = 9 cm,
Since, QS is perpendicular bisector of PR.
Therefore, PS = 18 cm.

Tangents drawn from an external point are equal.
Therefore, AQ = AP
BQ = BR
CS = CR
DS = DP
On adding we get that AB + CD = BC + AD.
Now, ∆𝐴𝑂𝑄 ≅ ∆AOP (SSS)
∠1 = ∠2 (CPCT)
Similarly, ∠3 = ∠4, ∠5 = ∠6, ∠7 = ∠8
Now, ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 =
360o (Complete angle)
=> ∠2 + ∠2 + ∠3 +∠3 + ∠6 + ∠6 + ∠7 +∠7 =

=> ∠2 + ∠3+∠6 + ∠7 = 180o
∠AOB + ∠COD = 180o

To Prove: BD = s – b

2s = AB + BC + AC…. [1]
As we know,

Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal
So we have
AF = AE… [2] [Tangents from point A]
BF = BD ….[3] [Tangents From point B]
CD = CE…. [4] [Tangents From point C]
Adding [2], [3], and [4],
AF + BF + CD = AE + BD + CE
AB + CD = AC + BD
Adding BD both side,
AB + CD + BD = AC + BD + BD
AB + BC – AC = 2BD
AB + BC + AC – AC – AC = 2BD
2s – 2AC = 2BD [From (1)]
2BD = 2s – 2b [as AC = b]
BD = s – b

Let AD = AF = x
BD = BE = y …[Two tangents drawn from and an external point are equal

Area = 14*14=196cm2
diameter of each circle =14/2=7cm
radius of each circle =7/2cm
Area of one circle=77/2cm2
Area of 4 circle= 154cm2
Area of shaded region = 196-154=42cm2
We will use the concepts related to the area of a sector of a circle to solve the
problem.
There are 8 equally spaced ribs in an umbrella, so the umbrella is assumed to be a flat
circle.
∴ The angle between 2 consecutive ribs (θ) = 360°/8 = 45°
The radius of the flat circle (r) is given as 70 cm.
The area between 2 consecutive ribs of the umbrella = Area of a sector with an angle
of 45° = θ/360° × πr2
= 45°/360° × 22/7 × 70 cm × 70 cm
= 1/8 × 22/7 × 70 cm × 70 cm
= 1925 cm2

17.

Radius of the circle, r=28 cm
We know,
Length of the wire = Circumference of the circle
=2×7/22×28=176 cm
Therefore, Perimeter of the square = Length of the wire =176 cm

18.

Therefore, the side of the square = Length of wire/4=176/4=44 cm
d=140 cm, r=70 cm
circumference=2×22/7×70=440cm =440/100 m =4.4 m
speed = 66 km/hr
distance covered in 1 minute = 66000 m/60 m= 1100 metre
no. of revolutions=distance covered / circumference
no. of revolutions=1100/ 4.4 =250

19.

Rate of fencing = Rs 24 per metre and, Total cost of fencing = Rs 5280
Length of the fence =Total cost/ rate = =5280 m / 24 =220 metre.
Circumference of the field =220 metres.
2πr=220, where r is the radius of the field
2×22/7×r=220
r=220×7x1/44=35 metres

2

∴ Area of the field =πr2
Area of the field =22/7×35×35 m2= 3850 m2
It is given that the field is ploughed at the rate of Rs .5 per m2
∴ Cost of ploughing the field = Rs 5 x 3850= Rs 19250

Radius of circular sheet (R) = 14 cm and radius of smaller circle (r) = 3.5 cm
Length of rectangle (l) = 3 cm and breadth of rectangle (b) = 1 cm
Area of the remaining sheet = Area of circular sheet – (Area of two smaller circle
+ Area of rectangle)
= πR2 – [2πr 2 + (length × Breadth)]
= 22/7 ×14 cm × 14 cm - [2 × 22/7 × 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm + (3 cm × 1 cm)]
= 22 × 2 cm × 14 cm - [44/7 × 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm + 3 cm]
= 616 cm2 - (77 + 3) cm2
= (616 - 80) cm2
= 536 cm2
Therefore, the area of the remaining sheet is 536 cm2.

21.

Given, radius (r) = 21 cm

2

Central angle = θ = 120
Area of sector = (πr2θ)/360
= (22/7) × (21 × 21) × (120/360)
= 22 × 21
= 462 cm2

22.

Given, radius = r = 14 cm
Length of arc = (2πrθ)/360
= 2 × (22/7) × 14 × (30/360)
= 22/3 cm

2

23.

According to the given,

2

Perimeter of circle = Area of circle
2πr = πr2
⇒ r = 2
Therefore, radius = 2 units

24.

Explanation: The angle subtended by the arc = 60°

2

So, area of the sector = (60°/360°) × π r2 cm2
= (441/6) × (22/7) cm2
= 231 cm2

25.

Length of an arc = (θ/360°) × (2πr)

2

∴ Length of an arc AB = (60°/360°) × 2 × 22/7 × 21
= (1/6) × 2 × (22/7) × 21
Or Arc AB Length = 22cm

Let actual radius=100 cm
Actual area= πr²= π x 100 x 100=10000 π sq cm
Decreased radius=50 cm
New area= πr² = π x 50 x 50=2500 π sq.cm
Changes in area =( 10000-2500) π= 7500 π
Percentage change in area=(7500 π)/(10000 π)) x 100 %=75%

πR2 = πr21 + πr22
πR2 = π(r21 + πr22) [ r1 = 10/2 = 5cm, r2 = 24/2 = 12 cm]
R2 = 52 + 122 = 25 + 144
R2 = 169 = 13 cm
∴ Diameter = 2(13) = 26 cm

Let ABCD be a square inscribed in a circle of radius 'r'. Now, the diameter of circle is
the diagonal of square.
Therefore, BD=2r. In △BDC, using Pythagoras theorem
BC² +CD² =BD²
⇒a²+a²=(2r)²
⇒2a²=4r²
⇒a² =2r²
∴Area of square=2r²
Area of circle=πr²
Required ration=πr²:2r² = π:2

Diameter of the wheel =1.26m
Radius of the wheel r= 1.26/2 m = 0.63m
The distance traveled in one revolution = perimeter of the wheel =2πr
=2 x 22/7 x (0.63) = 3.96 m
Thus, distance traveled in 500 revolutions =500×3.96m = 1980m
As we know that,
Perimeter of circle =2πr
Area of circle =πr²
Given that the perimeter and area of circle are numerically equal.
Therefore,
πr²=2πr

total distance= 2×22×0.25
11000×7 =7000 revolutions
Area of remaining part = Area of rectangle - Area of semicircle

Hence, area of remaining part =203 cm²

Each angle of equilateral triangle = 60°
Side of an equilateral triangle = 12 m
Length of the rope =7 m
Area of an equilateral triangle =
√3/4 x (side) ²= √3/4×12×12=62.35 m²
Area of sector with radius 7 m=
360°/60°× 22/7×7×7=25.66 m²
Now, Area which cannot be grazed by horse = Area of an
equilateral triangle - Area of sector with radius 7 m=62.35 m² − 25.66 m² = 36.68 m²
Given, central angle, θ = 120°
Radius of circle, r = 21 cm
We have to find the area of a sector of the circle.
Area of sector = πr²θ/360°
= π(21)²x(120°)/360°
= π(21)²(1/3)
= (22/7)x(21)x(21)x(1/3) = (22/7)x(21)x(7)
= (22)x(21)= 462 cm².
Therefore, the area of the sector is 462 cm².
Given,
Diameter =77 cm
Radius = D/2= 77/2 cm = 77 /200 m
Speed =1.1 m/s
Time =1 min 28 sec=88 sec
Distance can be completed as S×T=1.1×88=96.8 m
Circumference ⇒2×π×r=2× 22/7 × 77/200=2.42 m
∴ No. of Revolution = Circumference
Distance = 96.8/2.42 =40
∴ No. of revolution ⇒ 40
Initially, let the radius be 'r'.
Area=πr²
The radius is then reduced to = r/2
New area=π×(r/2)²=1/4×πr²
The area reduces to one-fourth of its initial area.

Number of tiles lengthwise = 𝟎.𝟓 =10tiles
𝟒
Number of tiles width wise = 𝟎.𝟓 =8tiles

So, 10 tiles are length wise and 8 tiles are width wise.
So, total number of tiles =10×8=80
∴ Area of floor not covered by tiles
Area of rectangular floor - Area of 80 tiles

Diameter of rear wheel =2m=200cm
Circumference of the front =2*22/7*40=1760/7cm
Distance cover=1400*1760/7=200*1460
Number of revolutions of wheel= distance by circumference=560
Here we have given a long path of length (l)= 120 m,
which is having semi-circular ends with inner radius 35 m.
Width of track (t)= 14 m
Hence, it can be said that outer radius = 14+35=49 m
Let, R (outer radius) = 49 m
And, r (inner radius) = 35 m.
Therefore, area of the track = area of the shaded region

The area available for horse to graze is nothing but "Area of Quadrant of a circle'
∴ Area of Quadrant =1/4xπ×r2=1/4x3.14×5×5
=19.625 m2
If the length of rope is increased to 10m then the new radius =10 m
∴ Area of new quadrant =1/4x3.14×10×10 =78.5 m2
∴ Increase in grazing area =78.5−19.625=58.875 m2

Given, Total length of the wire=44cm

3

∴ The circumference of the circle=2πr=44cm
⇒2×22/7×r=44
⇒r=44 x 7/(2x22)=7 cm
Now, Area of the circle=πr2=22/7×7×7=154 cm2
Now the wire is converted into square,
Then perimeter of square=44cm
⇒4× side=44
⇒ side=444=11cm
Now, area of square=side × side=11×11=121cm2
Therefore, on comparing the area of circle is greater than that of square, so the circle
enclosed more area.

Given, Sides of triangular field is 20m,34m and 42m
Semi-perimeter = (20 m+34 m+42 m)/2 =96 m/2= 48 m
Area of field= √[48(48−20)(48−34)(48−42)]

As the diameter of circular tile is 50 cm each, then radius=50 cm/2= 0.25 m

Number of tiles lengthwise =5m/ 0.5 m = 10 tiles
Number of tiles width wise =4 m/ 0.5m = 8 tiles
So, 10 tiles are length wise and 8 tiles are width wise.
So, total number of tiles =10×8=80
∴ Area of floor not covered by tiles
=Area of rectangular floor - Area of 80 tiles
=5×4 – 80x πr2

As the square is inscribed in a circle, a diagonal of the square will be = the
diameter of the circle.
Let “r” be the radius of the circle and “d” be the length of each diagonal of the
square.
We know,
Length of the diagonal of a square = side (s) × √2
So,
d = 2r
And, s × √2 = 2r
Or, s = √2r
We know, the area of the square = s2
Thus, the area of the square = (√2r)2 = 2r2
Now, the area of the circle = π × r2
∴ Area of the circle : area of the square = π × r2 : 2r2 = π : 2
So, the ratio of the area of the circle and the square is π : 2.

A
(i)Total wire is used = Length of wire in Circle + Wire used in 4 diameters Now,
Diameter of the brooch = 28 mm
Radius of brooch = 28/2 = 14 mm Length of wire in circle = Circumference of Circle
= 2πr = 2x 22 x 14 = 2 × 22 × 2 = 88 mm
Silver wire used in 4 diameters = 4 x Diameter of circle

4

= 4 × 28 = 112 mm
Now, Total wire is used = Length of wire in circle + Wire used in 4 diameters
= 88 + 112 = 200 mm
(ii)Since the wire divides the circle into 8 equal sectors
Area of each sector of the brooch
=1/8x Area of all sectors of brooch
=1/8x Area of circle
= 1/8 x πr²
= 1/8 x 22/7 x 14x14
=11x1x7 =77 mm²
B
(i)Given that Circumference of silver part is 44 mm
2πr = 44
2x22/7 x r = 44
r = 7mm
Thus, Radius of golden + silver part = 7 + 3 = 10 mm
Circumference of Golden part = 2π x Radius of (golden + silver) part
=2x22/7x10
= 62.86 mm
(ii) Difference b/w areas of golden and silver part
= Area of silver – Area of golden
= Area of circle of radius 10mm – Area of circle of radius 7mm
= π(10)²– π(7)² = 100π – 49π = 51π
16. 1. (i) (a): Since BOC is the diameter and ∠BAC = 90°
∴∴ BC2 =AB2 +AC2

= 72 + 242 = 625
⇒⇒ BC = 25 cm
∴ Radius of circle =25/2 cm=12.5cm

(ii) (c): Area of circle =π(12.5)2=227×12.5×12.5
= 491.07 cm2

Pendulum Clock : It is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging
weight, as its timekeeping element. From its invention in 1656
by Christiaan Huygens, the pendulum clock was the world’s
most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use.
Their greater accuracy allowed for the faster pace of life
which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution. The home
pendulum clock was replaced by less-expensive, synchronous,
electric clocks in the 1930s and 40s. Pendulum clocks are now
kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.

A calf is tied with a rope of length 6m at the corner of a square grassy lawn of
side 20m.
So, radius of quadrant DPQD (r) = length of rope = 6 m
Therefore,
Area of sector DPQD=θ/3600 x πr2
= 900/3600 x 3.14×(6)2
=1/4 x 3.14 x 36
=0.785×36=28.26 m2
Now, if the length of the rope is increased by 5.5 m
So, total length of the rope (R) = 6 + 5.5 = 11.5 m
Area of sector DRSD= θ/3600 x πR2
=1/4 x 3.14 × (11.5)2
=0.785×132.25=103.81 m2
Therefore,
Increased area = Area of sector DRSD – Area of sector DPQD
= 103.81 – 28.26
= 75.55 m2
= 75.56 m2
Hence, the increase in area of the grassy lawn is 75.56 m2.

Diameter =35mm
∴ Circumference of circle =2×π×r =2×π×17.5=110 mm
i) The total length of the silver wire required
= Circumference of circle + (5×35)
=110+175 = 285 mm
(ii) The area of each sector of the brooch
= Area of circle/10
=22/7 x 17.5×17.5/10

=96.25 mm2
9.

Area of the sector = θ/360 × π × r2
Base and height of the triangle formed will be = radius of the circle
Area of the minor segment = area of the sector – area of the triangle formed
Area of the major segment = area of the circle – area of the minor segment
Now,
Radius of circle = r = 20 cm and
Angle subtended = θ = 90°
Area of the sector = θ/360 × π × r2 = 90/360 × 22/7 × 202
Or, area of the sector = 314.2 cm2
Area of the triangle = ½ × base × height = ½ × 20 × 20 = 200 cm2
Area of the minor segment = 314.2 – 200 = 114.2 cm2
Area of the circle = π × r2 = (22/7) × 202 = 1257.14
Area of the major segment = 1257.14 – 114.2 = 1142 .94 cm2
So, the area of the corresponding major segment of the circle = 1142 .94 cm2

Here, as the equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle, the circle is an incircle.
Now, the radius of the incircle is given by,
r = Area of triangle/semi-perimeter
In the question, it is given that area of the incircle = 154 cm2
So, π × r2 = 154
Or, r = 7 cm
Now, assume the length of each arm of the equilateral triangle to be “x” cm
So, the semi-perimeter of the equilateral triangle = (3x/2) cm
And, the area of the equilateral triangle = (√3/4) × x2

We know, r = Area of triangle/semi-perimeter
So, r = [x2(√3/4)/ (3x/2)]
=> 7 = √3x/6
Or, x = 42/√3
Multiply both numerator and denominator by √3
So, x = 42√3/3 = 14√3 cm
Now, the perimeter of an equilateral triangle will be = 3x = 3 × 14√3 = 72.7 cm.

Now,
PD = PQ × (0.5) = 12 × 0.5 = 6 cm
Since, ∠QOP = 120o
Also,
∠DOP = ∠QOD = 60o
We have,
In triangle OPD, we have
Sin θ = PD/ OP
Sin 60o = 6/ OP
Substituting the values, we get,
√3/2 = 6/ OP
OP = 12/√3 = 4√3 = r
Now, calculating the area of the minor segment
Area of the segment = area of sector OPUQO – area of △OPQ
= (θ/360) x πr2 – ½ x PQ x OD
= (120/360) x π(4√3)2 – ½ x 12 x 2√3
{OD=√[(4√3)X(4√3) − (6𝑋6)] = 2√3}
= 16π – 12√3 = 4(4π – 3√3)

Area of the shaded region = area of the circle −area of the triangle ABC−area of the
quadrant COD
Here, in triangle ABC ∠CAB=90° (angle in a semicircle)
Hence triangle ABC is right-angled at A
Then applying Pythagoras theorem,
BC² =AC²+AB²
BC²=24² +7²
BC²=625
BC=25 cm
Therefore diameter of circle =25cm
i.e., Radius= 25/2 =12.5 cm
Then area of circle =πr²
=490.625 cm²
Area of ∆ABC= 1/2×base × height
=84 cm²
Area of quadrant = 1/4 ×πr²
=122.65625 cm²
Therefore area of shaded region =490.625−84−122.65625=283.96875 cm²

Surface area of the cube = 6 × (14)2= 6 × 196 = 1176 cm2
So, surface area of the remaining solid left out after the cone is carved out
= (1176 –154 - 154 √5)cm 2 =(1022- 154 √5)cm 2
ANS: The volume of the solid metallic sphere = (4/3)π(10.5)3 cm3
Volume of a cone of radius 3.5 cm and height 3 cm = (π/3)(3 .5) 2×3 cm3
Number of cones so formed= 126
ANS: Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,
the apparent capacity of the glass = πr2h
=3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3= 196.25 cm3
But the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at
the
base of the glass.
i.e., it is less by (2/3)πr3= (2/3)3.14x 2.5x 2.5x 2.5 cm3 = 32.71 cm3
So, the actual capacity of the glass = apparent capacity of glass – volume of
the

ANS: Let hbe height of the cylinder, and rthe

ANS: Volume of cone = (1/3)x πx6x 6x 24 cm3
If ris the radius of the sphere, then its volume is ( 4/3)x πr3 .
Since, the volume of clay in the form of the cone and the sphere remains the
same, we
Have
( 4/3)x πr3=(1/3)x πx6x 6x 24 cm3

The length of the diagonal of a cube is 8√3 cm
Length of edge = 8√3/√3 = 8 cm.
Let us assume r is the radius of cylinder and h is the height of cylinder
∴ Curved surface area of cylinder is 2πrh.
If the radius is doubled and height is halved,
⇒R=2r, H=h/2
∴Curved surface area of the cylinder =2πRH =2π(2r)(h/2) =2πrh
Therefore, the curved surface area of the cylinder will be the same.
Surface area of cube = 6 * (side length)^2 = 6 * (4 cm)^2 = 96 cm²
Total surface area of the cylindrical tank = CSA + 2 * Base area
CSA = 2 * π * radius * height = 2 * π * 7 cm * 21 cm = 294π cm²
Base area = π * (radius)^2 = π * (7 cm)^2 = 49π cm²
Total surface area = 294π + 49π = 343π cm²

Let n be the number of ice-cream cones.

Volume of cubical ice-cream brick = 22 cm × 22 cm × 22 cm
Radius of cone = r = 2 cm

Volume of cone = (1/3)πr2h = (1/3) × (22/7) × 2 × 2 × 7
So,
n × Volume of one cone = Volume of cubical ice-cream brick
n × (1/3) × (22/7) × 2 × 2 × 7 = 22 × 22 × 22
n × (1/3) × 4 = 22 × 22
n = (22 × 22 × 3)/4
n = 363

ANS: TSA of the toy =CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now,the curved surface area of the hemisphere =(1/2)(4 πr2)=2 πr2
=2x(22/7)x(3.5/2)2cm2
Also, the height of the cone = height of the top – height (radius) of the
hemispherical part
=5-(3.5/2)cm= 3.25 cm
So, the slant height of the cone (l) = √𝑟 2 + ℎ2 = 3.7 cm (approx.)
Therefore, CSA of cone = πrl= (22/7)x( 3.5/2)x3.7cm2 .
This gives the surface area of the top = 2x(22/7)x(3.5/2)2cm2+(22/7)x(

together.
Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m,
respectively.
Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.
So,the required volume = volume of the cuboid + ½(volume of the
cylinder)
=[15x7x8+(1/2)x(22/7)x(7/2)x(7/2)x15]m3= 1128.75 m3
Next, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3
And the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3= 1.6 m3
Therefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers
= 1128.75 – (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m3
ANS: Radius of the hemispherical tank = (3/2)m
Volume of the tank =( 2/3)( 22/7)( 3/2)3m3=(99/14) m3
So,the volume of the water to be emptied =(1/2)x(99/14) m3=(99/28)x1000

cost of painting = Rs.(14πr2) × 60/100 = Rs(42/5) πr2
It is given that the cost of painting is Rs. 237.60
∴ (42/5)πr2 = 237.60 ⇒ (42/5) × (22/7) × r2 = 237.60

Winnowing is the method in which heavier components of the mixture are
separated from the lighter substances with the help of wind. This method is
used for separating grains from husk. This method is based on the fact that the
husk particles are very light whereas wheat grains are comparatively heavy.

The mixture is allowed to fall from a height by shaking winnowing basket
continuously. The husk particles are
carried away by the wind to a greater distance. The wheat grains being heavy,
fall down vertically to the ground and form a conical shape.
After completing the winnowing process, a farmer found that the diameter of
the wheat cone so formed is 10.5 m and height is 3m.
(a) Find the volume of the wheat collected by the farmer.

A golf ball is a combination of (i) a Sphere and (ii) a hemisphere .
Diameter of the spherical golf ball = 4.1 cm
4.1
Radius of the spherical golf ball = cm

Surface area of the golf ball = 4πr = 4π × (

Radius of each dimple = 2 mm = cm
10
Since , the dimples are hemispherical , in case of each dimple , surface area πr 2 is
removed from the surface of the ball and the surface area of hemisphere
2πr 2 is exposed to the surrounding.
∴ TSA exposed to the surrounding = ( surface area of the ball ) ‒ (surface
Area of all the dimples ) + ( surface area of 150 hemisphere
)
= 16.81 π ‒ 150 πr 2 + 150 × 2 πr 2

10. The wooden toy rocket is the combination of

(i) a conical portion and (ii) a cylindrical portion .
Radius of the conical portion R = 2.5 cm
Height of the conical portion h = 6 cm
Slant height of the conical portion , l = √𝑅2 + 𝑟2 = √(2.5)2 + (6)2 cm
= √42.25 cm = 6.5
cm
Total height of the entire rocket , H = 26 cm
Height of the cylindrical portion , h‘= ( H ‒h) = ( 26 ‒ 6 ) cm = 20 cm
Radius of the cylindrical portion , r = 1.5 cm
Here the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the
cylinder , but the base of the cone is larger than the base
So, a part of the base of the cone ( a ring ) is to be painted .
Now, the area to painted orange
= (CSA of a cone ) + (Base area of the cone ) ‒ ( Base area of the
cylinder )
= π R l + π R2 ‒ πr 2 = π [R l + (R2 ‒ r 2 ) ] = π [ 2.5 × 6.5 + ( 2.5 ) 2 ‒ ( 1.5 )

20.25 π cm 2
=
3.14 × 20.25 cm 2
= 63.585 cm 2
Now, the area to painted yellow
= ( CSA of the cylinder ) + ( Area of one base of the cylinder )
= 2 π r h‘ + π r 2
=
[ 2 × 3.14 × 1.5 × 20 + 3.14 × 1.5 × 1.5 ] cm 2
= 3.14 × 1.5 × ( 2 × 20 + 1.5 ) cm 2
= 3.14 × 1.5 × 41.5 cm 2
= 4.71 × 41.5 cm 2
= 195.465 cm 2
=

Hence , the area of the rocket required to be painted with orange colour and
yellow colour are 63.585 cm 2 and 195.465 cm 2 respectively .

11. ANS: The total height of the bucket = 40 cm, which includes the height of the

base. So, the height of the frustum of the cone = (40 – 6) cm = 34 cm.
Therefore, the slant height of the frustum, l= √ℎ2 + (𝑟1 − 𝑟2 )2
where r1= 22.5 cm, r2= 12.5 cm and h= 34 cm.
So, l =35.44 cm
The area of metallic sheet used = curved surface area of frustum of cone
+ area of circular base
+ curved surface area of cylinder
= [π× 35.44 (22.5 + 12.5) + π× (12.5)2+ 2π× 12.5 × 6] cm2
=(22/7)(1240.4+ 156.25+ 150) cm2
= 4860.9 cm2.
Now, the volume of water that the bucket can hold (also, known as the
capacity
of the bucket)
𝜋×ℎ
=
× (r12+ r22+ r1 r2)
3
=(22/7)x(34/3)x[(22.5)2+ (12.5)2+ 22.5x 12.5]cm3 = 33615.48 cm3
= 33.62 litres (approx.)
12. ANS: Given that, length of cuboid pen stand (l) = 10 cm
Breadth of cubiod pen stand (b) = 5 cm
and height of cuboid pen stand (h) = 4 cm

5

5

Volume of cuboid pen stand=Ixbxh=10x5x4200cm3
Also radius of conical depression=0.5cm
And height(depth) of a conical depression h1=2.1cm
Volume of a conical depression =
1
𝜋𝑟 2 ℎ1 =(1/3)x(22/7)x0.5x0.5x2.1cm=0.55cm3
3
Also given edge of cubical depression a=3c.m
So, volume of cubical depression =27 cm3
So, volume of 4 conical depression = 4x(11/20)=11/5 cm3
Hence, the volume of wood in the entire pen stand = volume of cuboid pen
stand – volume of 4 conical depressions –volume of cubical depressions
=200-(11/5)-27=200-(146/5)
=200-29.2=170.8 cm3
So, the required volume of the wood in the entire stand is 170.8 cm3 .

Volume of cone B = ∏r2 (21 - h) = 66 cu cm

∏(3)2 (21 - h)

Volume of cylinder = ∏r2 h = ∏(3)2 21 = 594 cu cm
Volume of remaining portion = 594 - ( 132 + 66) = 396 cu cm
15. Wall is 24m long, 0.4m thick and 6m high.

5
3

So, volume of wall = 24m × 0.4m × 6m = 57.6m
Since 1/10 th of the volume of the wall is occupied by mortar, so the volume
of bricks in the wall,
1
=(1− ) part of the wall,
10
=9/10 th part of the wall
=9/10 × 57.6 m3 = 51.84 m3
Volume of one brick = 25cm×16cm×10cm
25/100 × 16/100 × 10/100 m3 = 0.004 m3
∴ Required number of bricks = (Volume of bricks in the wall)/(Volume of one
brick)
=51.84/0.004=12960
So, 12960 bricks are used in constructing the wall.

So, volume of the building = 3 𝜋 ( 5 ) + 𝜋 ( 5 ) ( 5 )

Thus, 3 𝜋 ( 5 ) + 𝜋 ( 5 ) ( 5 ) = 54 21
Hence, ℎ = 5 𝑚

18. Radius of the well =27 m
Depth of the well =10 m
Volume of the earth dug = π(7/2)2 × 10 = 22/7 × 7/2 × 7/2 × 10 = 358 m3
Length of the field = 14 m
breadth of the field =14 m
Area of the field = 20 × 14 = 280 m2
Area of the base of the well = π (7/2)2 = 22/7 × 7/2 × 7/2 = 77/2 m2
Area of the remaining part of the field = Area of the field - Area of the base of the field = (280 –
77/2 ) = 483/2
Let the rise in the level of the field be h metres
Volume of the raised field = Area of the base × height = ( 483/2 × h )
But volume of the raised field = Volume of the earth dug out
483/2 × h = 385 ⇒ h = (2×385)/483 = 1.594 m
Rise in the level of the field =1.594 m
19. Let the level of water in the tank will rise by 7 cm in x hrs
As the rate of flow of water is 5km/hr.
∴ Its length in x hrs = 5x km = 5000x metres
Water column forms a cylinder whose radius is r = 14/2 cm = 7/100 m
Volume of water flowing through the cylindrical pipe in x hrs = πr2 h
= 22/7 × (7/100)2 × 5000x = 77x m3

5

5

Vol. of water that falls into tank = 50 × 44 × 7/100 = 154 m3
But, the volume of water flowing through the cylindrical pipe in x hrs = Vol. of water that falls in
a tank in x hrs.
⇒ 77x = 154
∴ x = 154/77 = 2 hr.
20. TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone

5

Curved surface area of the hemisphere = 1/ 2 (4πr2) = 2π r2 = 2(22/7)× (3.5/2) × (3.5/2) =
19.25 cm2
Height of the cone = Height of the top – Radius of the hemispherical part
= (5 – 3.5/2) cm = 3.25 cm
Slant height of the cone (l)=3.7(approx.)
use l2=r2+h2 i.e. l2=(3.5/2)2+ (3.25)2
Therefore, CSA of cone = πrl = (22/7) × (3.5/2) × 3.7 = 20.35 cm2
Hence, the surface area of the top = [2(22/7)× (3.5/2) × (3.5/2) + (22/7) × (3.5/2) × 3.7] cm2
= (22/7) × (3.5/2) (3.5+3.7) cm2
= (11/2) × (3.5 + 3.7) cm2
= 39.6 cm2 (approx.)
21. It is known that a tent is a combination of a cone and a cylinder, as shown below.
From the question, we know that
The diameter = D = 4 m
l = 2.8 m (slant height)
The radius of the cylinder is equal to the radius of the cylinder
So, r = 4/2 = 2 m
Also, we know the height of the cylinder (h) is 2.1 m
So, the required surface area of the given tent = surface area of the cone (the top) + surface
area of the cylinder(the base)
= πrl + 2πrh

5

= πr (l+2h)
Now, substituting the values and solving it we get the value as 44 m2
∴ The cost of the canvas at the rate of Rs. 500 per m2 for the tent will be
= Surface area × cost/ m2
= 44 × 500
So, Rs. 22000 will be the total cost of the canvas.

Total number of outcomes = n(S) = 6
i.e. S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
n(E) = Number of outcomes favourable to the event E = 2
Since E = {1, 2}
Hence, the required probability = P(E) = n(E)/n(S)
= 2/6
= 1/3
( c)
When two coins are tossed, the total no of outcomes = 22 = 4
i.e. (H, H) (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)
Possible outcomes = (H, T), (T, H), (H, H)
Number of possible outcomes = 3
Hence, the required probability = ¾

ANSWERS:
Q. NO
1.

ANSWER
Total number of possible outcomes n(S) = 62 = 36
(i)
Getting the same number on both dice:
Possible outcomes are (1,1), (2,2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5) and (6, 6).
Number of possible outcomes = n(A) = 6
Hence, the required probability =P(A) = n(A)/n(S)
= 6/36
= 1/6
(ii)

Getting a different number on both dice.

MARKS
2

Number of possible outcomes n(B) = 36 – Number of possible outcomes for
the same number on both dice = 36 – 6 = 30
Hence, the required probability = P(B) = n(B)/n(S)
= 30/36
= 5/6
2.

When Two coins are tossed simultaneously
Total no. of Outcomes = 22= 4 [ (H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T) ]
Number of favourable outcomes = (H,T), (T,H), (T,T) = 3
Probability og getting at least one tail = favourable outcomes/ Total no. of outcomes
=3/4

2

3.

Number of integers between 1 and 100:
2, 3, 4, 5, --------------99.
Sample space or total outcomes n(S) = 98
i) Numbers which are divisible by 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96
so number of possible event n(E) = 12
now probability divisible by 8 , P(E)= n(E) /n(S)= 12/98= 6/49
ii) P (not divisible by 8 ) = 1- 6/49= 43/49

ANSWER
The number of possible outcomes = Number of balls in the bag = n(S) = 3.
(i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = n(Y) = 1.
So, P(Y) = n(Y)/n(S) =1/3Similarly,
(ii) P(R) = 1/3and
(iii) P(B) = ⅓

MARKS
3

Total number of outcomes = 80
Perfect square numbers from 1 to 80 = 1 ,4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64
Therefore, favourable outcomes = 8
Probability of getting a perfect square number = 8/80 = 1/10.

For a/b>1, when a=1,b cannot take any value,
a=2,b can take 1 value,

a=3,b can take 2 value,
a=4,b can take 3 values,
a=5,b can take 4 values,
a=6,b can take 5 values.
Total possible outcomes =36
∴P(a/b>1)=(1+2+3+4+5)/36 =15/36 or 5/12

2.

The total no. of possible outcomes= 100
(i) No. of even numbers from 1 to 100 = 50
∴ P ( A even number ) = 50/100= ½
(ii) Multiples of 13 from 1 to 100 are 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78 and 91
No. of favourable Outcomes = 7
∴ P (multiple of 13 )= 7/100
(iii) Perfect square no, from 1 to 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100
No. of favourable outcomes = 10
∴ P ( perfect square number) = 10/100=1/10
(iv) Prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19
No. of favourable outcomes = 8
∴ P ( A prime number less than 20 ) = 8/100= 2/25.

(i)a is correct option (ii) c is correct option.
(iii) Class 110-120 has the maximum frequency 24, therefore this is model class. (d) is correct
option.
(iv) Here, l = 110, f1 = 24, f0 = 20, f2 = 8 and h = 10 (d) is correct option
(I)Ans : 20 +++ 60 70 x + 60 = 250 210 + x = 250 x = 250 − 210 = 40Thus (a) is correct option
(II) (b) is correct option.

(III) Cumulative frequency just
greater than N/2=250/2=125 is 150
and
the corresponding class is 120-140.
Thus
median class is 120-140 and upper
limit is
140. Thus (d) is correct option.
(IV) Class 120-140 has the maximum frequency 70, therefore this is model class. Here, l = 120,
f1 = 70, f0 = 60, f2 = 60 and h = 20, Thus (b) is correct option.

The mean of 9 items is 15. If one more item is added to this series, the mean becomes 16.
Find the value of the 10th item.
Answer:

6.

Answer:

5

7.

Now, mean (x̄) = ∑fixi∑fi
62.8 = (50x+2640)40+x
⇒ 62.8 (40 + x) = 50x + 2640
⇒ 2512 + 62.8x = 50x + 2640
⇒ 12.8x = 128
⇒ x = 12812.8 = 10
Answer:

5

Median = 32.5
∴ Median class is 30-40
Median = l+(N2−C)f × h
Here, l = 30, N = 40, C = 14 + f1
f1 = 12, h = 10
∴ 32.5 = 30 + 1012(20 – 14 – f1)
⇒ f1 = 3
Also, 31 + f1 + f2 = 40
Putting f1 = 3 in (2)
⇒ f2 = 6

f1=18,f2=29

explanation of Assertion (A).
(c) Assertion (A) is true but Reason (R) is false.
(d) Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.

27. Assertion: If the height of a cone is 24 cm and diameter of the base is 14 cm, then the
slant height of the cone is 15 cm.
Reason: If r be the radius and h the slant height of the cone, then slant height = √ℎ2 + 𝑟 2

Reason: If r be the radius and h be the height of the cylinder, then total surface area =
(2𝜋𝑟ℎ + 2𝜋𝑟 2 ).

29. Assertion: If the radius of a cone is halved and volume is not changed, then height
remains same.
Reason: If the radius of a cone is halved and volume is not changed then height must
become four times of the original height.

30. Assertion: No. of spherical balls that can be made out of a solid cube of lead whose edge
is 44 cm, each ball being 4 cm. in diameter, is 2541
Reason: Number of balls = Volume of one ball / Volume of lead

31. Assertion: If a ball is in the shape of a sphere has a surface area of 221.76 cm2, then its
diameter is 8.4 cm.
Reason: If the radius of the sphere be r, then surface area, 𝑆 = 4𝜋𝑟 2 , 𝑖. 𝑒.,

Find the value of “p” from the polynomial x2 + 3x + p, if one of
thezeroes of the polynomial is 2.
Solution:
As 2 is the zero of the polynomial.
We know that if α is a zero of the polynomial p(x), then p(α) = 0
Substituting x = 2 in x2 + 3x + p,
⇒ 22 + 3(2) + p = 0
⇒4+6+p=0
⇒ 10 + p = 0
⇒ p = -10

Find the quadratic polynomial if its zeroes are 0, √5.
Solution:
A quadratic polynomial can be written using the sum and product of its
zeroes as:
x2 – (α + β)x + αβ
Where α and β are the roots of the polynomial.

1

Here, α = 0 and β = √5

So, the polynomial will be:
x2 – (0 + √5)x + 0(√5)
= x2 – √5x

Write two solutions for the following equation:
3x + 4y = 7
Page 7 of 9

Sol : 3x + 4y =7 ….(1)
Step 1: Isolate above equation in y.
Subtract 3x from both the sides,
3x + 4y – 3x = 7 – 3x
4y = 7 – 3x
Divide each side by 4
y = 1/4 x (7 – 3x) ….(2)
Step 2: Find Solutions
Substituting x = 1 in (2)
y = 1/4 x (7 – 3) = 1/4 x 4 = 1
Thus x = 1 and y = 1 is the solution of 3x + 4y = 7
Again, Substituting x = 2 in (2)
y = 1/4 x (7 – 3 x 2) = 1/4 x 1 = 1/4
Thus x = 2 and y = 1/4 is the solution of 3x + 4y = 7
Therefore, (1, 1) and (2, 1/4) are two solution of 3x + 4y = 7.

The Sum of a two digit number and the number obtained by reversing
the order of its digits is 121. If units and ten’s digit of the number are x
and y respectively, then write the linear equation representing the above
statement.
Solution:
As per the statement given, the number is 10y + x.
On reversing the digits of the number, we get, 10x + y
Sum of the two numbers is 121. (Given)
10y + x + 10x + y = 121
11x + 11y = 121
x + y = 11
Which represents the required linear equation.
Or
A number is 27 more than the number obtained by reversing its digits. lf
its unit’s and ten’s digit are x and y respectively, write the linear
equation representing the statement.
Solution:
Given: The original number is 27 more than the number obtained by
reversing its digits
The given number is in the form of 10y + x.
Number produced by reversing the digits of the number is 10x + y.
As per statement:
10y + x = 10x + y + 27
10y – y + x – 10x = 27
9y – 9x = 27
9 (y – x) = 27
y–x=3
x – y+3 =0
Above equation represents the required linear equation.

Solve 2x + 3y = 11 and 2x – 4y = – 24 and hence find the value of ‘m’
for which y = mx + 3.
Solution:
2x + 3y = 11… ..................................... (i)
2x – 4y = -24… .................................... (ii)
From equation (i), we get;
x = (11 – 3y)/2 ....................................................... (iii)

1

Putting the value of x in equation (ii), we get
2[(11 – 3y)/2] – 4y = −24
11 – 3y – 4y = -24
-7y = -35
y = 5… ..................................................... (iv)
Putting the value of y in equation (iii), we get;
x = (11 – 15)/2 = -4/2 = −2
Hence, x = -2, y = 5
Also,
y = mx + 3
5 = -2m +3
-2m = 2
m = -1
Therefore, the value of m is -1.

For which values of a and b does the following pair of linear equations
have an infinite number of solutions?
2x + 3y = 7
(a – b)x + (a + b)y = 3a + b – 2
Solution:
We have, 2x + 3y = 7…..(i)
(a – b) x + (a + b) y = 3a + b – 2 … (ii)
Here, a1 = 2, b1 = 3, c1 = 7 and
a2 = a – b, b2 = a + b, c2 = 3a + b – 2
Page 9 of 9

For infinite number of solutions, we have

1

9a – 7a + 3b – 75 -6 = 0 ⇒ 2a – 45 – 6 = 0 => 2a – 4b = 6
⇒ a – 2b = 3 …(iv)
Putting a = 5b in equation (iv), we get
56 – 2b = 3 or 3b = 3 i.e., b = 33 =1
Putting the value of b in equation (ii), we get a = 5(1) = 5
Hence, the given system of equations will have an infinite number of
solutions for a = 5 and b = 1.

OR
For which value of k will the following pair of linear equations have no
solution?
3x + y = 1
(2k – 1)x + (k – 1)y = 2k + 1
Solution :
We have, 3x + y = 1, 3x + y − 1 = 0 …(i)
(2k – 1) x + (k – 1) y = 2k + 1
⇒ (2k – 1) x + (k – 1) y – (2k + 1) = 0 ……(ii)
Here, a1 = 3, b1 = 1, C1 = -1
a2 = 2k – 1, b2 = k – 1, C2 = -(2k + 1)
For no solution, we must have

⇒ 3k – 2k = 3 – 1 ⇒ k = 2
Hence, the given system of equations will have no solutions for k = 2.

Section V
Draw the graph of 2x + y = 6 and 2x – y + 2 = 0. Shade the region

When x = 0, we have y = 6 – 2 × 0 = 6
When x = 3, we have y = 6 – 2 × 3 = 0
When x = 2, we have y = 6 – 2 × 2 = 2
Thus, we get the following table:

Now, we plot the points A(0,6), B(3,0) and C(2, 2) on the graph paper.
We join A, B and C and extend it on both sides to obtain the graph of
the equation 2x + y = 6.

We have, 2x – y + 2 = 1 = y = 2x + 2
When x = 0, we have y = 2 × 0 + 2 = 2
When x = -1, we have y = 2 × (-1) + 2 = 0
When x = 1, we have y = 2 × 1 + 2 = 4
Thus, we have the following table:

For set A 2 Area is 4 sq.units.
Compute the zeroes of the polynomial 4x2 – 4x – 8. Also, establish a
relationship between the zeroes and coefficients.
Solution:
Let the given polynomial be p(x) = 4x2 – 4x – 8
Page 11 of
9

To find the zeroes, take p(x) = 0
Now, factorise the equation 4x2 – 4x – 8 = 0
4x2 – 4x – 8 = 0
4(x2 – x – 2) = 0
x2 – x – 2 = 0
x2 – 2x + x – 2 = 0
x(x – 2) + 1(x – 2) = 0
(x – 2)(x + 1) = 0
x = 2, x = -1
So, the roots of 4x2 – 4x – 8 are -1 and 2.
Relation between the sum of zeroes and coefficients:
-1 + 2 = 1 = -(-4)/4 i.e. (- coefficient of x/ coefficient of x2)
Relation between the product of zeroes and coefficients:
(-1) × 2 = -2 = -8/4 i.e (constant/coefficient of x2)

OR
Compute the zeroes of the polynomial 4u2 + 8u . Also, establish a
relationship between the zeroes and coefficients.
Solution :
We have, p(u) = 4u2 + 8u = p(u) = 4u (u + 2)
The zeros of polynomial p(u) is given by
p(u) = 0 ⇒ 4u (u + 2) = 0 .
∴ u = 0, -2
Thus, the zeros of 4u2 + 8u are α = 0 and β = -2
Now, sum of the zeros = α + β = 0 – 2 = -2

The sum of two numbers is 8. If their sum is four times their difference,
find the numbers.
Let the numbers be ‘a’ and ‘b’.
Given that, sum of two numbers is 8.
⟹ a + b = 8 ...(1)
Also, their sum is four times their difference
⟹ a + b = 4(a – b)
⟹ a + b = 4a – 4b
⟹ 3a -5b = 0 ...(2)
Substituting value of 'a' from equation (2) in equation (1)
5
⇒ 3b + b = 8
5𝑏+3𝑏

⇒ 3 =8
⇒ 8b = 24
⇒b=3

As per given condition
Reena has total 40 pens and pencils.
So, x + y =40 ..........(i)
And if she has 5 more pencils and 5 less pens, then number of pencils
would become 4 times the number of pens.
So, y + 5 = 4( x- 5)

If, 5 is factor of a, it means that we can write a = 5c for some integer c.
Substituting value of a in (1) ,
5b2 = 25c2
⇒ b2 = 5c2
It means that 5 is factor of b2.
Hence, 5 is also factor of b by Theorem. ... (3)
From (2) and (3) , we can say that 5 is factor of both a and b .
But, a and b are co-prime .
Therefore, our assumption was wrong. √5 cannot be rational. Hence, it is
irrational.
Find the zeroes of quadratic polynomial given as: 6x2- 3 - 7x and also verify 3
the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.
We have been given the quadratic equation as: 6x2- 3 - 7x
First of all we will write it into standard form as: 6x2- 7x - 3
(Now we will factorize 7 such that the product of the factors is equal to - 18
and the sum is equal to - 7)
It can be written as
= 6x2+ 2x - 9x - 3
= 2x(3x + 1) - 3(3x + 1)
= (3x + 1)(2x - 3)

There is a circular path around a sports field. Sonia takes 96 minutes to
walk one round of the field, while Ravi takes 80 minutes for the same.
Suppose they both start at the same point and at the same time, and go in
the same direction. After how many minutes will they meet again at the
starting point?

They will be meet again after LCM of both values at the starting point.
96 = 25 × 3 , 80 = 24 × 5
𝐿𝐶𝑀 = 25 × 3 × 5 = 480 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠

A two-digit number is 4 more than 6 times the sum of its digits. If 18 is
subtracted from the number, the digits are reversed. Find the number.
Suppose the digits at units and tens place of the given number be x and y
respectively.
∴ the number is 10y+x
The number is 4 more than 6 times the sum of the two digits.
∴ 10y + x = 6(x + y)+ 4
⇒ 10y + x = 6x + 6y + 4
⇒ 6x + 6y − 10y − x = −4
⇒ 5x − 4y = −4 ....(i)
After interchanging the digits, the number becomes 10x+y
If 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits are reversed. Thus, we have
(10y + x)− 18 = 10x + y
⇒ 10x + y − 10y − x = −18
⇒ 9x − 9y = −18
⇒ 9(x − y)= −18
−18
⇒x − y = 9
⇒ x − y = −2 …..(ii)
So, we have the systems of equations
5x − 4y = −4,
x − y = −2
Here x and y are unknowns. We have to solve the above systems of
equations for x and y.
Multiplying the second equation by 5 and then subtracting from the first, we
have
(5x - 4y) - (5x - 5y) = -4 - (-2 × 5)
⇒ 5x − 4y − 5x + 5y = −4 + 10
⇒y=6
Substituting the value of y in the second equation, we have
x - 6 = -2
x=6-2
x=4
Hence, the number is 10 ×6 + 4 = 64

It is given that
3x - y = 7 .......(1)
2x + 5y+1 = 0 .........(2)

Hence, given pair of linear equations has a unique solution.
From (i) y = 3x - 7

and from (ii) 2x + 5y + 1 = 0
or, 5y = -1 - 2x

𝑎

So, 5 + 2√3 = 𝑏 , where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are coprime (𝑏 ≠ 0)
Rearranging, we get
√3 =

𝑎 − 5𝑏
2𝑏

Since 5, 2, a and b are integers,

and the number of students initially in hall B be 𝑦.
Case I: When number of students in both halls are equal.
∴ 𝑥 – 10 = 𝑦 + 10

Prove that opposite sides of a quadrilateral circumscribing a circle subtend
supplementary angles at the centre of the circle.
Sol.

Given that a quadrilateral ABCD circumscribes a circle with centre O at points
P, Q, R, and S.
To prove : ∠AOB+∠COD = 180° , ∠BOC+∠DOA = 180°
1½

Construction : Join OP, OQ, OR, OS
Proof : In triangles OAP and OAS,
AP = AS (Tangents from the same point A)
OA = OA (Common side)
OP = OS (Radii of the circle)
So, by SSS congruency △OAP ≅ △OAS
∠1 = ∠2
Similarly, ∠4 = ∠3, ∠5 = ∠6, ∠7 = ∠8
Now by adding these angles we get,
∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 + ∠7 + ∠8 = 360°
2∠1 + 2∠3 + 2∠7 + 2∠6 = 360°
Or (∠1 + ∠3) + (∠7 + ∠6) = 180°
Thus, ∠AOB+∠COD = 180°
Similarly, it can be proved that ∠BOC+∠DOA = 180°

PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and
Q intersect at a point T. Find the length TP.

bisector of ∠ PTQ.
So, OT ⊥ PQ and therefore, OT bisects PQ which gives
PR = RQ = 4 cm.
Also, OR = √𝑂𝑃2 − 𝑃𝑅 2 = √52 − 42 = 3 cm .

(Code No. 041)
Session – 2024-25
The Syllabus in the subject of Mathematics has undergone changes from time to time in
accordance with growth of the subject and emerging needs of the society. Senior Secondary stage
is a launching stage from where the students go either for higher academic education in
Mathematics or for professional courses like Engineering, Physical and Biological science,
Commerce or Computer Applications. The present revised syllabus has been designed in
accordance with National Curriculum Framework 2005 and as per guidelines given in Focus Group
on Teaching of Mathematics 2005 which is to meet the emerging needs of all categories of
students. Motivating the topics from real life situations and other subject areas, greater emphasis
has been laid on application of various concepts.
Objectives

The broad objectives of teaching Mathematics at senior school stage intend to help the students:


to acquire knowledge and critical understanding, particularly by way of motivation and
visualization, of basic concepts, terms, principles, symbols and mastery of underlying
processes and skills.



to feel the flow of reasons while proving a result or solving a problem.



to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve problems and wherever possible, by
more than one method.



to develop positive attitude to think, analyze and articulate logically.

Note: For activities NCERT Lab Manual may be referred.

Conduct of Periodic Tests:
Periodic Test is a Pen and Paper assessment which is to be conducted by the respective
subject teacher. The format of periodic test must have questions items with a balance mix,
such as, very short answer (VSA), short answer (SA) and long answer (LA) to effectively
assess the knowledge, understanding, application, skills, analysis, evaluation and synthesis.
Depending on the nature of subject, the subject teacher will have the liberty of incorporating
any other types of questions too. The modalities of the PT are as follows:

a) Mode: The periodic test is to be taken in the form of pen-paper test.
b) Schedule: In the entire Academic Year, three Periodic Tests in each subject may be
conducted as follows:

Test
Tentative Month

Pre Mid-term (PT-I) Mid-Term (PT-II)

Post Mid-Term (PT-III)

July-August

December-January

November

This is only a suggestive schedule and schools may conduct periodic tests as per their
convenience. The winter bound schools would develop their own schedule with similar time
gaps between two consecutive tests.

c) Average of Marks: Once schools complete the conduct of all the three periodic tests,
they will convert the weightage of each of the three tests into ten marks each for identifying
best two tests. The best two will be taken into consideration and the average of the two
shall be taken as the final marks for PT.

d) The school will ensure simple documentation to keep a record of performance as
suggested in detail circular no.Acad-05/2017.

e) Sharing of Feedback/Performance: The students’ achievement in each test must be
shared with the students and their parents to give them an overview of the level of learning
that has taken place during different periods. Feedback will help parents formulate
interventions (conducive ambience, support materials, motivation and morale-boosting)
to further enhance learning. A teacher, while sharing the feedback with student or parent,
should be empathetic, non- judgmental and motivating. It is recommended that the
teacher share best examples/performances of IA with the class to motivate all learners.

Assessment of Activity Work:
Throughout the year any 10 activities shall be performed by the student from the activities
given in the NCERT Laboratory Manual for the respective class (XI or XII) which is
available on the link: http://www.ncert.nic.in/exemplar/labmanuals.htmla record of the
same may be kept by the student. An year end test on the activity may be conducted

The weightage are as under:


The activities performed by the student throughout the year and record keeping
: 5 marks



Assessment of the activity performed during the year end test: 3 marks



Viva-voce: 2 marks

Questions 1 to 20 carry 1 mark each.

1. In a formula racing competition, the time taken by two racing cars A and B to complete 1 round of
the track is 30 minutes and p minutes respectively. If the cars meet again at the starting point for the
first time after 90 minutes and the HCF (30, p) = 15, then the value of p is
(a)45 minutes
(b)60 minutes
(c)75 minutes
(d)180 minutes
Ans: (a)45 minutes
LCM = 90 and HCF = 15
We know that HCF x LCM = Product of two numbers
⇒ 15 x 90 = 30 x p
⇒ p = 45
2. The solution of the following pair of equation is:
x – 3y = 2, 3x – y = 14
(a) x = 5, y = 1 (b) x = 2, y = 3
(c) x = 1, y = 2
Ans: (a) x = 5, y = 1
Given, equations are x – 3y = 2 …(i)
and 3x – y = 14 …(ii)
Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get y = 1
x = 2 + 3y = 2 + 3 × 1 = 5
Hence, x = 5 and y = 1

(d) x = 1, y = 4

3. If two positive integers a and b are written as a = x3y2 and b = xy3, where x and y are prime
numbers, then the HCF (a, b) is:
(a) xy
(b) xy2
(c) x3y3
(d) x2y2
3 2
3
Ans: (b) Here, a = x y and b = xy
⇒ a = x × x × x × y × y and b = xy × y × y
∴ HCF(a, b) = x × y × y = x × y2 = xy2
4. The ratio in which x-axis divides the join of (2, -3) and (5, 6) is:

If two cubes of edges 6 cm are joined face to face it will take the shape of a cuboid whose length,
breadth and height are (6 + 6) cm, 6cm and 6cm i.e. 12 cm, 6cm and 6cm respectively.
Thus, total surface area of the cuboid = 2 (lb + bh + lh)
= 2 (12× 6 + 6× 6 + 12× 6)
= 2 (72 + 36 + 72)
= 2 ×180 cm2 = 360 cm2

(a) 7
(b) 14
(c) 21
(d) 28
Ans: (b) 14
Total number of eggs = 400
Probability of getting a bad egg P(E) = 0.035
Consider x as the number of bad eggs
P(E) = Number of bad eggs/ Total number of eggs
Substituting the values
0.035 = x/400 ⇒ 35/1000 = x/400 ⇒ x = 35/1000 x 400

circle is
(a) 10 cm
(b) 7.5 cm
(c) 5 cm
(d) 2.5 cm

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 4-

Ans: (c) 5 cm
we know that radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact
⇒ OP ⊥ AP and OQ ⊥ AQ
Also sum of all angles of a quadrilateral is 360°
⇒∠O + ∠P + ∠A + ∠Q = 360°
⇒∠O + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°
⇒∠O = 360° – 270° = 90°
Thus ∠O = ∠P = ∠A = ∠Q = 90° and OP = OQ (radii)
⇒ OPAQ is a square
⇒ radius = OP = OQ = AP = AQ = 5 cm

Direction : In the question number 19 & 20 , A statement of Assertion (A) is followed by a
statement of Reason(R) . Choose the correct option
19. Assertion (A): If x = 2 sin2θ and y = 2 cos2θ + 1 then the value of x + y = 3.
Reason (R): For any value of θ, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
Ans: We know that for any value of θ, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
So, Reason is correct.
For assertion: We have x = 2 sin2θ and y = 2 cos2θ + 1
Then, x + y = 2 sin2θ + 2 cos2θ + 1
= 2(sin2θ + cos2θ) + 1
= 2 x 1 + 1 [∵ sin2θ + cos2θ = 1]
= 2 + 1 = 3.
Hence, Assertion is also correct.
Correct option is (a) Both assertion (A) and reason (R) are true and reason (R) is the correct
explanation of assertion (A).

Two concentric circles are of radii 8 cm and 5 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle
which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: Let O be the center of the concentric circle.

Let AB be the chord of larger circle touching the smaller circle at P.
Here, OA = 8 cm, OP = 5 cm
Since AB is tangent of P to the smaller circle and OP is the radius of the smaller circle.
∴ OP ⊥ AB.
In right triangle APO, we have
OA2 = AP2 + OP2 ⇒ (8)2 = AP2 + (5)2 ⇒ AP2 = 64 – 25 = 39

Sumit is 3 times as old as his son. Five years later, he shall be two and a half time as old as his son.
How old is Sumit at present?
Ans: Let present age of Sumit be x years and present age of his son be y years.
∴ x = 3y ⇒ x – 3y = 0 ...(i)
After 5 years, Age of Sumit = (x + 5) years
Age of his son = (y + 5) years
According to the question,
1
(x + 5) = 2 (y + 5)
2
5
⇒ (x + 5) = (y + 5)
2
⇒ 2x + 10 = 5y + 25 ⇒ 2x – 5y = 15 ...(ii)
From equation (i) and (ii), we get y = 15
Putting y = 15 in equation (i), we get x = 3 × 15 = 45 years
∴ Sumit is 45 years old at present.

27. If PQ is a tangent drawn from an external point P to a circle with centre O and QOR is a diameter
where length of QOR is 8 cm such that ∠POR = 120°, then find OP and PQ.
Ans: Let O be the centre and QOR = 8 cm is diameter of a circle.
PQ is tangent such that ∠POR = 120°.

Now, OQ = OR = 8/2 = 4 cm
∠POQ = 180° – 120° = 60° (Linear pair)
Also OQ ⊥ PQ
Now, in right ΔPOQ,
cos 60° = OQ/PO ⇒ 1/2 = OQ/PO
⇒ 1/2 = 4/PO ⇒ PO = 8 cm
Again, tan 60° = PQ/OQ ⇒ √3 = PQ/4

152x – 378y = –74 and –378x + 152y = –604
Ans: We have, 152x – 378y = –74 ...(i)
–378x + 152y = –604 ...(ii)
Adding equation (i) and (ii), we get
⇒ –226(x +y) = –678
⇒ x + y = 3 …(iii)
Subtracting equation (ii) from (i), we get
530x – 530y = 530
⇒ x – y = 1 …(iv)
Adding equations (iii) and (iv), we get 2x = 4 ⇒ x = 2
Putting the value of x in (iii), we get

which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: Let O be the centre of the concentric circle of radii 5 cm and 3 cm respectively. Let AB be a
chord of the larger circle touching the smaller circle at P

Then AP = PB and OP⊥AB
Applying Pythagoras theorem in △OPA, we have
OA2 = OP2 + AP2 ⇒ 25 = 9 + AP2

26. Four bells toll at an interval of 8, 12, 15 and 18 seconds respectively. All the four begin to toll
together. Find the number of times they toll together in one hour excluding the one at the start.
Ans: Prime factorisation of the given numbers are:
8 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 23
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 22 × 31
15 = 3 × 5 = 31 × 51
18 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 21 × 32
LCM (8, 12, 15 and 18) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 8 × 9 × 5 = 360 sec = 6 min
∴ Four bells toll together in one hour = 60 ÷ 6 = 10 times.

Find the quadratic polynomial sum and product of whose zeros are –1 and –20 respectively. Also
find the zeroes of the polynomial so obtained.
Ans: Let α and β be the zeros of the quadratic polynomial.
∴ Sum of zeros, α + β = – 1
and product of zeros, α. β = – 20
Now, quadratic polynomial be
x2 – (α + β) . x + α β = x2 –(–1) x – 20 = x2 + x – 20
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Now, for zeroes of this polynomial
x2 + x – 20 = 0 ⇒ x2 + 5x – 4x – 20 = 0
⇒ x(x + 5) – 4 (x + 5) = 0 ⇒ (x + 5) (x – 4) = 0
⇒ x = – 5, 4
∴ zeroes are – 5 and 4
28. The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth
is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area
increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
Ans: Let length and breadth be x and y , Area = xy
1st condition: ( x – 5 ) ( y + 3 ) = xy – 9
⇒ 3x – 5y = 6
2nd condition: ( x + 3 ) ( y + 2 ) = xy + 67
⇒ 2x + 3y = 61
Solve 1st and 2nd equations, we get x = 17 and y = 9
Hence, Length of rectangle = 17 units and breadth of rectangle = 9 units
29. In the below figure, XY and X′Y′ are two parallel tangents to a circle with centre O and another
tangent AB with point of contact C intersecting XY at A and X′Y′ at B. Prove that ∠AOB = 90°.

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC

In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7-

Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.

Ans: AC is tangent to circle with centre O.
Thus ∠ACO = 90°

Ans: Total number of outcomes = 36
(i) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is 5 = 4
∴ Required Probability = 4/36 = 1/9
(ii) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is 10 = 3
∴ Required Probability = 3/36 = 1/12
(i) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is at least 9 = 10

32. A motor boat whose speed is 18 km/h in still water takes 1 hour more to go 24 km upstream than to
return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
Ans: Let the speed of the stream be x km/h.
Therefore, the speed of the boat upstream = (18 – x) km/h and the speed of the boat downstream =
(18 + x) km/h.
24
The time taken to go upstream = distance/speed =
18  x
24
Similarly, the time taken to go downstream =
18  x
24
24
According to the question,

1
18  x 18  x
24(18 + x) – 24(18 – x) = (18 – x) (18 + x)
x2 + 48x – 324 = 0
x = 6 or – 54
Since x is the speed of the stream, it cannot be negative. So, we ignore the root x = – 54. Therefore,
x = 6 gives the speed of the stream as 6 km/h.
OR
An express train takes 1 hour less than a passenger train to travel 132 km between Mysore and
Bangalore (without taking into consideration the time they stop at intermediate stations). If the
average speed of the express train is 11km/h more than that of the passenger train, find the average
speed of the two trains.
Ans: Ans: Let the average speed of the passenger train = x km/hour
And the average speed of the express train = (x + 11) km/hour.
132
The time taken by the passenger train =

⇒ x2 + 11x −1452 = 0
⇒ (x − 33)(x + 44) = 0 ⇒ x = 33, x = − 44
The speed cannot be negative, so the speed of the passenger train is 33 km/hour and the speed of the express
train is 33 + 11 = 44 km/ hour.

Ans: (b) 2
Let us consider the points as A = (2, -2) and B = (-1, x)
AB = 5 units
⇒ 52 = (-1 - 2)2 + (x + 2)2 ⇒ 25 = (-3)2 + (x + 2)2
⇒ 25 = 9 + x2 + 4 + 4x ⇒ 25 = x2 + 4x + 13
⇒ x2 + 4x + 13 - 25 = 0 ⇒ x2 + 4x - 12 = 0
⇒ x2 + 6x - 2x - 12 = 0 ⇒ x(x + 6) - 2(x + 6) = 0
⇒ (x + 6)(x - 2) = 0
⇒ x + 6 = 0 ⇒ x = -6
And x - 2 = 0 ⇒ x = 2

A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/h faster, it
would have taken 4 hours less than the scheduled time. And, if the train were slower by 6 km/hr; it
would have taken 6 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.
Ans: Let the actual speed of the train be x km/hr and let the actual time taken be y hours.
Distance covered is xy km If the speed is increased by 6 km/hr, then time of journey is reduced by 4
hours i.e., when speed is (x+6)km/hr, time of journey is (y−4) hours.
∴ Distance covered = (x + 6)(y − 4)
⇒ xy = (x + 6)(y − 4) ⇒ −4x + 6y − 24 = 0 ⇒ −2x + 3y −12 = 0
………….(i)
Similarly xy = (x − 6)(y + 6) ⇒ 6x − 6y − 36 = 0 ⇒ x − y − 6 = 0
…………(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii) we get x=30 and y=24
Putting the values of x and y in equation (i), we obtain
Distance = (30 × 24)km =720km.
Hence, the length of the journey is 720km.
27. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that 2 + 5√3 is irrational.
Ans: Let us assume 2 + 5√3 is rational, then it must be in the form of p/q where p and q are coprime integers and q ≠0
i.e 2 + 5√3 = p/q
p  2q
So √3 =
…(i)
5q
Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0, RHS of equation (i) is rational.
But LHS of (i) is √3 which is irrational. This is not possible. This contradiction has arisen due to
our wrong assumption that 2 + 5√3 is
rational
So, 2 + 5√3 is irrational.

31. In the given figure, AB is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents to the
circle at A and B intersect at P. Find the length of AP.

Ans: AB = 8 cm ⇒ AM = 4 cm
∴ OM = √(52 – 42) = 3 cm

Let AP = y cm, PM = x cm
∴ ∆OPA is a right angle triangle
∴ OP2 = OA2 + AP2
(x + 3)2 = y2 + 25
⇒ x2 + 9 + 6x = y2 + 25 ...(i)
Also, x2 + 42 = y2 ...(ii)
⇒ x2 + 6x + 9 = x2 + 16 + 25
⇒ 6x = 32
⇒ x = 32/6 = 16/3 cm
∴ y2 = x2 + 16 = 256/9 + 16 = 400/9
⇒ y = 20/3 cm

In ΔOAP and ΔOAS
AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)
OA=OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT)
⇒ ∠1=∠8
Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰
⇒ 2(∠1) + 2(∠2) + 2(∠5) + 2(∠6) = 360⁰

32. A motorboat whose speed in still water is 9 km/h, goes 15km downstream and comes back to the
same spot, in a total time of 3 hours 45 minutes. Find the speed of the stream.
Ans: Let speed of stream be x km/h.
Given, Speed of boat = 9 km/h
Distance covered upstream = 15 km
Distance covered downstream = 15 km
Total time taken = 3 hours 45 minutes = 15/4 hours
Now, Speed of boat upstream = 9 − x km/h
Speed of boat downstream = 9 + x km/h

SECTION-E (Case Study Based Questions)
Questions 36 to 38 carry 4M each
36. Aditya is a fitness freak and great athlete. He always wants to make his nation proud by winning
medals and prizes in the athletic activities.

An upcoming activity for athletes was going to be organised by Railways. Aditya wants to
participate in 200 m race. He can currently run that distance in 51 seconds. But he wants to increase
his speed, so to do it in 31 seconds. With each day of practice, it takes him 2 seconds less.
(i) He wants to makes his best time as 31 sec. In how many days will be able to achieve his target?
(ii) What will be the difference between the time taken on 5th day and 7th day.
OR
(ii) Which term of the arithmetic progression 3, 15, 27, 39 .... will be 120 more than its 21st term?
Ans: Ans:
(i) Let, the number of days taken to achieve the target be n.
In the given A.P., a = 51, d = – 2
Since an = a + (n – 1)d ⇒ 31 = 51 + (n – 1)(– 2)
⇒ 31 – 51 = (n – 1)(– 2) ⇒ – 20 = (n – 1) (– 2)
⇒ (n – 1) = 10 ⇒ n = 11
Hence, 11 days are needed to achieve the target.
(ii) a5 = a + 4d = 51 + 4(– 2) = 51 – 8 = 43 sec
a7 = a + 6d = 51 + 6(– 2) = 51 – 12 = 39 sec
Now, time difference = 43 – 39 = 4 sec.
OR
(ii) We have, a = 3 and d = 12
∴ a21 = a + 20d = 3 + 20 × 12 = 243
Let nth term of the given AP be 120 more than its 21st term. Then, an = 120 + a21
⇒ 3 + (n – 1)d = 120 + 243
⇒ 3 + 12(n – 1) = 363 ⇒ 12(n – 1) = 360
⇒ n – 1 = 30 ⇒ n = 31
Hence, 31st term of the given AP is 120 more than its 21st term.

(2)
OR
(ii) If the elevation of the sun at a given time is 30°, then find the length of the shadow cast by a
tower of 150 feet height at that time.
(2)
Ans: (i) In the figure, let C be the position of the observer (the girl).
A and P are two positions of the balloon.
CD is the horizontal line from the eyes of the (observer) girl.
Here PD = AB = 88.2 m − 1.2 m = 87 m

Thus, the required distance between the two positions of the balloon = 58 √3 m
= 58 x 1.732 = 100.46 m (approx.)
(ii) Speed of the balloon = Distance/time = 100.46/30 = 3.35 m/s (approx.)

(a) 4πrh + 2πr2
(b) 4πrh – 2πr2
(c) 2πrh + 4πr2
(d) 2πrh + 4πr
Ans: (c) 2πrh + 4πr2
Curved surface area of cylinder = 2πrh
The curved surface area of hemisphere = 2πr2
Here, we have two hemispheres.
So, total curved surface area = 2πrh + 2(2πr2) = 2πrh + 4πr2

(a) 0 only
(b) 8 only
(c) 0,8
(d) 4
Ans: (c) 0,8
For equal roots, D = b2 – 4ac = 0
⇒ (-k)2 – 4(2)(k) = 0
⇒ k2 – 8k = 0 ⇒ k(k – 8) = 0 ⇒ k= 0,8

8. If ½ is a root of the equation x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0, then the value of k is
(a) 2
(b) – 2
(c) ¼
(d) ½
Ans: (a) 2
If ½ is a root of the equation
x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0 then, substituting the value of ½ in place of x should give us the value of k.
Given, x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0 where, x = ½
(½)2 + k (½) – (5/4) = 0
⇒ (k/2) = (5/4) – ¼ ⇒ k = 2

a2 = -3; b2 = -6; c2 = 1
a1/a2 = -1/3
b1/b2 = -2/6 = -1/3
c1/c2 = 5/1 = 5
Here, a1/a2 = b1/b2 ≠ c1/c2
Therefore, the pair of equation has no solution.
10. The point which lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining point A (–2, –5) and
B (2, 5) is:
(a) (0, 0)
(b) (0, –1)

The probability of its being a face card = 12/52 = 3/13
12. The ratio in which the line segment joining the points P(-3, 10) and Q(6, –8) is divided by O(-1, 6)
is:
(a) 1:3
(b) 3:4
(c) 2:7
(d) 2:5
Ans: (c) 2:7
Let k :1 be the ratio in which the line segment joining P( -3, 10) and Q(6, -8) is divided by point O(1, 6).
By the section formula, we have -1 = ( 6k – 3)/(k + 1)
⇒ –k – 1 = 6k – 3
⇒ 7k = 2 ⇒ k = 2/7
Hence, the required ratio is 2:7.

Hence, for m = 5, the system has infinitely many solutions.
22. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomials p(t) = 5t2 + 12t + 7 and verify the relationship between
the zeroes and the coefficients.
Ans: 5t2 + 12t + 7 = 0 ⇒ 5t2 + 5t + 7t + 7 = 0
⇒ 5t (t + 1) + 7(t + 1) = 0 ⇒ (t + 1)(5t + 7) = 0
⇒ t + 1 = 0 ⇒ t = -1
5t + 7 = 0 ⇒ 5t = -7 ⇒ t = -7/5
Therefore, zeroes are (-7/5) and -1
Now, Sum of the zeroes = – (coefficient of x) ÷ coefficient of x2
α + β = – b/a
⇒ (- 1) + (- 7/5) = – (12)/5
⇒ – 12/5 = – 12/5
Product of the zeroes = constant term ÷ coefficient of x2
α β = c/a
⇒ (- 1)(- 7/5) = 7/5
⇒ 7/5 = 7/5

Number of possible outcomes = 6
Therefore, the probability of getting same number on both dice = 6/36 = 1/6
(ii) Different number on both dice.
Number of possible outcomes = 36 – 6 = 30
Therefore, the probability of getting different number on both dice = 30/36 = 5/6

24. A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC.
Ans: We know that the lengths of tangents drawn from an exterior point to a circle are equal.

AP = AS ... (i) [tangents from A]
BP = BQ ... (ii) [tangents from B]
CR = CQ ... (iii) [tangents from C]
DR = DS ... (iv) [tangents from D]
AB + CD = (AP + BP) + (CR + DR)
= (AS + BQ) + (CQ + DS) [using (1), (ii), (iii), (’v)]
= (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
=AD+ BC.
Hence, AB + CD = AD + BC.
25. Find the points on the x–axis which are at a distance of 2√5 from the point (7, –4). How many such
points are there?
Ans: Let coordinates of the point=(x, 0)(given that the point lies on x axis)
x1 = 7, y1=-4and x2 = x, y2=0
Distance =√(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2
According to the question, 2√5=√(x – 7)2+ (0 – 4(-4))2
Squaring L.H.S and R.H.S, we get 20 = x2 + 49 – 14x + 16
⇒ 20=x2 + 65 – 14x ⇒ x2 – 14x + 45 = 0 ⇒ x2 – 9x – 5x + 45 = 0
⇒ x(x – 9) – 5(x – 9) = 0 ⇒ (x – 9) (x – 5) = 0 ⇒ x – 9 = 0, x – 5 = 0

cm, respectively. Find the minimum distance each should walk so that each can cover the same
distance in complete steps.
Ans: Step measures of three persons are 40 cm, 42 cm and 45 cm.
The minimum distance each should walk so that each can cover the same distance in complete steps
is the LCM of 40 cm, 42 cm and 45 cm.
Prime factorisation of 40, 42 and 45 gives
40 = 23 × 5, 42 = 2 × 3 × 7, 45 = 32 × 5
LCM (40, 42, 45) = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved in the numbers

D is the point on the ground from where the angles of elevation of the bottom B and the top A of
the transmission tower AB are 45° and 60° respectively.
The distance of the point of observation D from the base of the building C is CD.
Combined height of the building and tower = AC = AB + BC
In ΔBCD, tan 45° = BC/CD
⇒ 1 = 20/CD
⇒ CD = 20
In ΔACD, tan 60° = AC/CD
⇒ √3 = AC/20

Height of the tower, AB = AC - BC
⇒ AB = 20√3 - 20 m = 20 (√3 - 1) m
28. In the below figure, if ∠1 =∠2 and ΔNSQ = ΔMTR, then prove that ΔPTS ~ ΔPRQ.

Ans: According to the question, ∆ NSQ ≅ ∆MTR and ∠1 = ∠2
Since, ∆NSQ = ∆MTR
So, SQ = TR ….(i)
Also, ∠1 = ∠2 ⇒ PT = PS….(ii) [sides opposite to equal angles]
From Equation (i) and (ii),
PS/SQ = PT/TR
⇒ ST || QR (By converse of basic proportionality theorem)
∴ ∠1 = ∠PQR and ∠2 = ∠PRQ (corresponding angles)
In ∆PTS and ∆PRQ.
∠P = ∠P [Common angles]
∠1 = ∠PQR (proved)
∠2 = ∠PRQ (proved)
∴ ∆PTS – ∆PRQ [By AAA similarity criteria]

Ans: Given equations are 2x + y = 23 …(i)
4x – y = 19 …(ii)
On adding both equations, we get 6x = 42
⇒x=7
Put the value of x in Eq. (i), we get
2(7) + y = 23
⇒ y = 23 – 14

Hence 5y – 2x = 5(9) – 2(7) = 45 – 14 = 31
y/x – 2 = 9/7 -2 = -5/7
31. In the given figure, OP is equal to diameter of the circle. Prove that ABP is an equilateral triangle.

Ans: Join OP and let it meets the circle at point Q.
Since OP = 2r (Diameter of the circle)
⇒ OQ = QP = r
Consider ΔAOP in which OA ⊥ AP and OP is the hypotenuse.
∴ OQ = AQ = OA
(Mid-point of the hypotenuse is equidistant from the vertices)
⇒ OAQ is an equilateral triangle.
⇒ ∠AOQ = 60° (Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°)

Consider right-angled triangle OAP.
∠AOQ = 60° (Proved above)
∠OAP = 90° ⇒ ∠APO = 30°
∠APB = 2∠APO = 2 × 30° = 60°
Also PA = PB (Tangents to a circle from an external point are equal.)

is cut, drilled and has holes punched in it. It is then fine polished using sandpaper. For the retail
packaging and delivery activity center, the polished wood sub-parts are assembled together, then
decorated using paint. The total height of the toy is 26 cm and the height of its conical part is 6 cm.
The diameters of the base of the conical part is 5 cm and that of the cylindrical part is 3 cm. On the
basis of the above information, answer the following questions:

(a) If its cylindrical part is to be painted yellow, find the surface area need to be painted. [1]

(b) Find the volume of the wood used in making this toy. [2]
(c) If the cost of painting the toy is 3 paise per sq cm, then find the cost of painting the toy. (Use π =
3.14) [1]
Ans: Let the radius of cone be r, slant height of cone be l, height of cone be h, radius of cylinder be
r′ and height of cylinder be h′.
Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r′ = 1.5 cm, h′ = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and
Slant height, l  r 2  h 2  2.52  62  6.25  36  42.25  6.5cm
(a) Area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder + area of one base of the cylinder
= 2πr′h′ + π(r′)2 = πr′ (2h′ + r′) = (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm2
= 4.71 × 41.5 cm2
= 195.465 cm2
(b) Area to be painted green = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone – base area of the cylinder
= πrl + πr2 – π(r′)2 = π[(2.5 × 6.5) + (2.5)2 – (1.5)2] cm2
= π[20.25] cm2 = 3.14 × 20.25 cm2
= 63.585 cm2

are 2 main types: guyed and self-supporting structures. On a similar concept, a radio station tower
was built in two sections A and B.
Tower is supported by wires from a point O. Distance between the base of the tower and point O is
36 m. From point O, the angle of elevation of the top of section B is 30° and the angle of elevation
of the top of section A is 45°.

(i) What is the height of the section B?
(1)
(ii) What is the height of the section A?
(1)
(iii) What is the length of the wire structure from the point O to the top of section A? (2)
OR
(iii) What is the length of the wire structure from the point O to the top of section B? (2)
Ans: Given, that the distance between the base of the tower and point O = 36 m

∴ Height of section A = 36 – 12√3 = 12(3 – √3) m
(iii) length of the wire structure from the point O to the top of the section
cos 450 =

38. Mohan is an auto driver. His autorickshaw was too old and he had to spend a lot of money on repair
and maintenance every now and then. One day he got to know about the EV scheme of the
Government of India where he can not only get a good exchange bonus but also avail heavy
discounts on the purchase of an electric vehicle. So, he took a loan of 71,18,000 from a reputed
bank and purchased a new autorickshaw.
Mohan repays his total loan of 118000 rupees by paying every month starting with the first
instalment of 1000 rupees.

(i) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount will be paid by him
in the 30th instalment? [1]
(ii) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount of loan does he still
have to pay after 30th instalment? [2]
OR
(ii)If he increases the instalment by 200 rupees every month, then what amount would he pay in
40th instalment? [2]
(iii) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount will be paid by
him in the 100th instalment [1]
Ans: (i) Clearly, the amount of installment in the first month = Rs. 1000, which increases by Rs.
100 every month
therefore, installment amount in second month = Rs. 1100, third month = Rs. 1200, fourth month =
Rs. 1300 .....
which forms an AP, with first term, a = 1000 and common difference, d = 1100 - 1000 = 100
Now, amount paid in the 30th installment,
a30 = 1000 + (30 - 1)100 = 3900 [∵ an = a + (n - 1)d]
(ii) Amount paid in 30 instalments,
30
S30 =
[2 x 1000 + (30 - 1)100] = 73500
2
Hence, remaining amount of loan that he has to pay = 118000 - 73500 = Rs. 44500
OR
If he increases the instalment by 200 rupees every month, amount would he pay in 40th instalment
Then a = 1000, d = 200 and n= 40
a40 = a + 39d
⇒ a40 = 1000 + 39(200)
⇒ a40 = 880
(iii) Here, a = 1000 and common difference, d = Rs. 100
Amount paid in the 100th instalments
a100 = 1000 + (100 - 1)100 = 10900 [∵ an = a + (n - 1)d]

21 = 3 × 7
15 = 3 × 5
So, HCF = 3; LCM = 22 × 3 × 7 i.e., 420
7. If the sum of LCM and HCF of two numbers is 1260 and their LCM is 900 more than their HCF,
then the product of two numbers is
(a) 205400
(b) 203400
(c) 194400
(d) 198400
Ans: (c) 194400
Let the HCF of the numbers be x and their LCM be y.
It is given that the sum of the HCF and LCM is 1260, therefore
x + y = 1260 ....(i)
And, LCM is 900 more than HCF.
y = x + 900..... (ii)
Substituting (ii) in (i), we get x + x + 900 =1260
⇒ 2x + 900 = 1260
⇒ 2x = 1260 - 900 ⇒ 2x = 360 ⇒ x = 180
Substituting x = 180 in (1), we get:
y = 180 + 900 ⇒ y = 1080
We also know that the product the two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and HCF
Thus, product of the numbers = 1080(180) = 194400

the measure of AB is

(a) 37 cm
(b) 16cm
(c) 30 cm
(d) 39 cm
Ans: (c) 30 cm
∵ Tangent is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.
∠OQA = ∠OPA = 90° and OQ = OP [Radii]
∴ OQAP is a square.

Now, CR = CS = 23 cm [Tangents from an external point to a circle are equal]
∴ BS = 39 - 23 = 16cm
And BS = BP = 16 cm [Tangents from an external point to a circle are equal]
Now, AB = AP + BP = 14 + 16 = 30cm

21. A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC.

Ans: We know that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to the circle
are equal.
DR = DS ...... (i)
BP = BQ ...... (ii)
AP = AS ...... (iii)
CR = CQ ...... (iv)
Adding (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), we get DR + BP + AP + CR = DS + BQ + AS + CQ
By rearranging the terms we get,
(DR + CR) + (BP + AP) = (CQ + BQ) + (DS + AS)
⇒ CD + AB = BC + AD
Hence it is proved AB + CD = AD + BC.

24. Find the value of p if the pair of equations 2x + 3y – 5 = 0 and px – 6y – 8 = 0 has a unique
solution.
Ans: Given, pair of linear equations is 2x + 3y – 5 = 0 and px – 6y – 8 = 0
On comparing with ax + by + c = 0 we get
Here, a1 = 2, b1 = 3, c1 = – 5;
And a2 = p, b2 = – 6, c2 = – 8;
a1 /a2 = 2/p, b1 /b2 = – 3/6 = – ½, c1 /c2 = 5/8
Since, the pair of linear equations has a unique solution,
∴ a1/a2 ≠ b1/b2
⇒ 2/p ≠ – ½
⇒p≠–4
Hence, the pair of linear equations has a unique solution for all values of p except – 4.

Given that √3 is irrational, prove that (2 + 5√3) is an irrational number.

2 + 5√3 = a, where a is a non-zero rational number.
a 2

Since 5 and 2 are integers and a is a rational number, therefore

28. In the given figure, PA and PB are the tangent segments to a circle with centre O. Show that the
points A, O, B and P are concyclic.

Ans: Here, OA = OB
And OA ⊥ AP, OB ⊥ BP (tangent ⊥ radius)
∴ ∠OAP = 90°,
∠OBP = 90°
∴ ∠OAP + ∠OBP = 90° + 90° = 180°
∴ ∠AOB + ∠APB = 180°
(Since, ∠AOB + ∠OAP + ∠OBP + ∠APB = 360°)
Thus, sum of opposite angle of a quadrilateral is 180°.
Hence, A, O, B and P are concyclic.

Ans: In ∆ABC, AC 2  AB 2  BC 2  (14) 2  (48)2  50 cm
∠OQB = 90°⇒ OPBQ is a square ⇒ BQ = r
⇒ QA = 14 - r = AR (tangents from a external point are equal in length)
Again PB = r ⇒ PC = 48 - r

the remaining a card is drawn at random. Find the probability that the card drawn is (i) a black
queen (ii) a red card (iii) a face card.
Ans: From the total playing 52 cards, red coloured jacks, queen, kings and aces are removed(i.e.,
2 jacks, 2 queens, 2 kings, 2 aces) ∴ Remaining cards = 52 – 8 = 44
(i) Favourable cases for a black queen are 2 (i.e., queen of club or spade)
∴ Probability of drawing a black queen = 2/44 = 1/22
(ii) Favourable cases for red cards are 26 – 8 = 18 (as 8 cards have been removed) (i.e.9 diamonds
+ 9 hearts)
∴ Probability of drawing a red card = 18/44 = 9/22
(iii) Favourable cases for a face card are 6 (i.e. 2 black jacks, queens and kings each)
∴ Probability of drawing a face card = 6/44 = 3/22

The given zeroes of required polynomial are 2a + 3b and 3a + 2b

Sum of the zeroes = 2a + 3b + 3a + 2b = 5a + 5b = 5(a + b) = 5 ×
=

2
Again, product of the zeroes = (2a + 3b) (3a + 2b) = 6 (a2 + b2) + 13ab
= 6 [(a + b)2 – 2ab)] + 13 ab = 6(a + b)2 + ab
= 6(5/2)2 + 7/2 = 75/2 + 7/2 = 82/2 = 41
Now, required polynomial is given by
25
k [x2 – (Sum of the zeroes) x + Product of the zeroes] = k [ x2 –
x + 41]

k

Solving by cross multiplication, 6(2x − 9) = x2 – 9x

⇒ x2−18x−3x+54=0
⇒ x(x − 18) − 3(x − 18)=0
⇒ (x − 18)(x − 3) = 0
⇒ x = 18, x = 3
Neglecting x = 3 as x – 9 can’t negative, therefore x = 18
If we take x = 18
Smaller tap = (x) = 18 hrs
Larger tap = (x – 9) = 18 – 9 = 9hrs
Hence, the time taken by the smaller tap to fill the tank = 18 hrs & the time taken by the larger
tap to fill the tank = 9 hrs

the row next to it and so on (see below figure). In how may rows are the 200 logs placed and how
many logs are in the top row?

Ans: Here, a is the first term, d is a common difference and n is the number of terms.
It can be observed that the number of logs in rows are forming an A.P. 20, 19, 18, ...
n
We know that sum of n terms of AP is given by the formula Sₙ = [2a + (n - 1) d]
2
n
⇒ 200 = [2 × 20 + (n - 1)(- 1)] ⇒ 400 = n [40 - n + 1] ⇒ 400 = n [41 - n]
2
⇒ 400 = 41n - n² ⇒ n² - 41n + 400 = 0 ⇒ n² - 16n - 25n + 400 = 0
⇒ n(n - 16) - 25(n - 16) = 0 ⇒ (n - 16)(n - 25) = 0
⇒ Either (n -16) = 0 or (n - 25) = 0
∴ n = 16 or n = 25
The number of logs in nth row will be aₙ = a + (n - 1) d
⇒ a₁₆ = a + 15d ⇒ a₁₆ = 20 + 15 × (- 1) ⇒ a₁₆ = 20 – 15 ⇒ a₁₆ = 5
Similarly, a₂₅ = 20 + 24 × (- 1)
⇒ a₂₅ = 20 – 24 ⇒ a₂₅ = - 4

Clearly, the number of logs in the 16th row is 5. However, the number of logs in the 25th row is
negative 4, which is not possible.
Therefore, 200 logs can be placed in 16 rows. The number of logs in the top (16th) row is 5.

The sum of the third and the seventh terms of an AP is 6 and their product is 8. Find the sum of
first sixteen terms of the AP.
Ans: Here, a is the first term, d is the common difference and n is the number of terms.
Given: a₃ + a₇ = 6 ----- (1)
a₃ × a₇ = 8 ----- (2)
We know that nth term of AP is aₙ = a + (n - 1)d
Third term, a₃ = a + 2d ----- (3)
Seventh term, a₇ = a + 6d ----- (4)
Using equation (3) and equation (4) in equation (1) to find the sum of the terms,
(a + 2d) + (a + 6d) = 6
⇒ 2a + 8d = 6 ⇒ a + 4d = 3 ⇒ a = 3 - 4d ----- (5)
Using equation (3) and equation (4) in equation (2) to find the product of the terms,
(a + 2d ) × (a + 6d ) = 8
Substituting the value of a from equation (5) above,
(3 - 4d + 2d) × (3 - 4d + 6d) = 8
⇒ (3 - 2d) × (3 + 2d) = 8
⇒ (3)² - (2d)² = 8 [Since (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b² ]
⇒ 9 - 4d² = 8 ⇒ 4d² = 1 ⇒ d² = ¼ ⇒ d = ½, -½

SECTION-E (Case Study Based Questions)
Questions 36 to 38 carry 4M each
36. Mayank a student of class 7th loves watching and playing with birds of different kinds. One day
he had an idea in his mind to make a bird-bath on his garden. His brother who is studying in class
10th helped him to choose the material and shape of the birdbath. They made it in the shape of a
cylinder with a hemispherical depression at one end as shown in the Figure below. They opted for
the height of the hollow cylinder as 1.45 m and its radius is 30 cm. The cost of material used for
making bird bath is Rs. 40 per square meter.

(i) Find the curved surface area of the hemisphere. (Take π = 3.14)
(ii) Find the total surface area of the bird-bath. (Take π = 22/7)
(iii) What is total cost for making the bird bath?
OR
(iii) Mayank and his brother thought of increasing the radius of hemisphere to 35 cm with same
material so that birds get more space, then what is the new height of cylinder?
Ans: (i) Let r be the common radius of the cylinder and hemisphere and h be the height of the
hollow cylinder.
Then, r = 30 cm and h = 1.45 m = 145 cm.
Curved surface area of the hemisphere = 2πr2
=2 x 3.14 x 302 = 0.56 m2
(ii) Let S be the total surface area of the birdbath.
S = Curved surface area of the cylinder + Curved surface area of the hemisphere
⇒ S = 2πrh+ 2πr2 = 2πr(h + r)
22
⇒S=2x
x 30(145 + 30) = 33000 cm2 = 3.3 m2
7
(iii) Total Cost of material = Total surface area x cost per sq m2
= 3.3 x 40 = Rs. 132
OR
We know that S = 3.3 m2

bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two bridge towers connected at the upper
level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping.
In this bridge, two towers of equal heights are standing opposite each other on either side of the
road, which is 80 m wide. During summer holidays, Neeta visited the tower bridge. She stood at
some point on the road between these towers. From that point between the towers on the road, the
angles of elevation of the top of the towers was 60° and 30° respectively.

(i) Find the distances of the point from the base of the towers where Neeta was standing while
measuring the height.
[2]
(ii) Neeta used some applications of trigonometry she learned in her class to find the height of the
towers without actually measuring them. What would be the height of the towers she would have
calculated?
[2]
OR
(ii) Find the distance between Neeta and top of tower AB? Also, Find the distance between Neeta
and top tower CD?
[2]
Ans: (i) Suppose AB and CD are the two towers of equal height h m. BC be the 80 m wide road.
P is any point on the road. Let CP be x m, therefore BP = (80 - x).
Also, ∠APB = 60° and ∠DPC = 30°

38. On the roadway, Points A and B, which stand in for Chandigarh and Kurukshetra, respectively,
are located nearly 90 kilometres apart. At the same time, a car departs from Kurukshetra and one
from Chandigarh. These cars will collide in 9 hours if they are travelling in the same direction,
and in 9/7 hours if they are travelling in the other direction. Let X and Y be two cars that are
travelling at x and y kilometres per hour from places A and B, respectively. On the basis of the
above information, answer the following questions:

In ∆ABP, sin 600 

(a) When both cars move in the same direction, then find the situation can be represented
algebraically.
[2]
OR
(a) When both cars move in the opposite direction, then find the situation can be represented
algebraically.
[2]
(b) Find the speed of car x.
[1]
(c) Find the speed of car y.
[1]
Ans: (a) Suppose two cars meet at point Q. Then, Distance travelled by car X = AQ, Distance
travelled by car Y = BQ. It is given that two cars meet in 9 hours.
∴ Distance travelled by car X in 9 hours = 9x km = AQ = 9x
Distance travelled by car Y in 9 hours = 9y km = BQ = 9y
Clearly, AQ - BQ = AB = 9x - 9y = 90 = x - y = 10
OR
Suppose two cars meet at point P. Then Distance travelled by car X = AP and Distance travelled
by car Y = BP.

In this case, two cars meet in hours. Distance travelled by car X in hours

(b) We have x - y = 10 and x + y = 70
Adding equations (i) and (ii), we get 2x = 80 ⇒ x = 40
Hence, speed of car X is 40 km/hr.
(c) We have x - y = 10 ⇒ 40 - y = 10 ⇒ y = 30
Hence, speed of car y is 30 km/hr

26. A part of monthly hostel charges in a college is fixed and the remaining depends on the number
of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student ‘A’ takes food for 22 days, he has to
pay Rs. 1380 as hostel charges; whereas a student ‘B’, who takes food for 28 days, pays Rs.
1680 as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
Ans: Let the fixed hostel charges be Rs. x and the cost of food per day be Rs. y.
According to the question, we get
x + 22y = 1380 ...(i)
and x + 28y = 1680 ...(ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get
6y = 300 ⇒ y = 300 ÷ 6 = 50
Putting y = 50 in (i), we get
x + 22(50) = 1380 ⇒ x + 1100 = 1380 ⇒ x = 280
∴ Fixed hostel charges = Rs. 280 and cost of the food per day = Rs. 50.

Ans: Let Meena has received x no. of Rs. 50 notes and y no. of Rs. 100 notes.
So, 50x + 100y = 2000 ... (i)
x + y = 25 ... (ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get y = 15
Putting y = 15 in equation (ii), we get
x + 15 = 25

q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p
and q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
28. What number should be added to the polynomial x2 – 5x + 4 so that 3 is the zero of the

Ans: Let k be the number to be added to the given polynomial.
Then the polynomial becomes x2 – 5x + (4 + k)
As 3 is the zero of this polynomial, we get (3)2 – 5(3) + (4 + k) = 0
⇒ (4 + k) = 15 – 9 ⇒ 4 + k = 6 ⇒ k = 2
Thus, 2 is to be added to the given polynomial.

32. Some students planned a picnic. The total budget for food was Rs. 2,000. But 5 students failed
to attend the picnic and thus the cost of food for each member increased by Rs. 20. How many
students attended the picnic and how much did each student pay for the food?
Ans: Case I. Let number of students = x
and cost of food for each member = Rs. y
Then x × y = 2,000 ...(i)
Case II. New number of students = x – 5
New cost of food for each member = Rs. (y + 20)
Then (x – 5)(y + 20) = 2,000
⇒ xy + 20x – 5y – 100 = 2,000 ...(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x = –20, 25
x = –20 is rejected because number of students can’t be negative.
So, x = 25 ⇒ y = 80
Number of students = 25
Cost of food for each student = Rs. 80.

If Zeba was younger by 5 years than what she really is, then the square of her age (in years)
would have been 11 more than five times her actual age. What is her age now?
Ans: Let the present age of Zeba be x years.
Age before 5 years = (x – 5) years
According to given condition, (x – 5)2 = 5x + 11
⇒ x2 + 25 – 10x = 5x + 11 ⇒ x2 – 10x – 5x + 25 – 11 = 0
⇒ x2 – 15x + 14 = 0 ⇒ x2 – 14x – x + 14 = 0
⇒ x (x – 14) – 1 (x – 14) = 0 ⇒ (x – 1) (x – 14) = 0
⇒ x – 1 = 0 or x – 14 = 0 ⇒ x = 1 or x = 14
But present age cannot be 1 year.
Hence, Present age of Zeba is 14 years.

Also, sum of frequencies = 100
⇒ 68 + f1 + f2 = 100

Saving money is a good habit and it should be inculcated in children from the beginning. A
father brought a piggy bank for his son Aditya. He puts one five-rupee coin of his savings in the
piggy bank on the first day. He increases his savings by one five-rupee coin daily.

(i) If the piggy bank can hold 190 coins of five rupees in all, find the number of days he can
contribute to put the five-rupee coins into it
(ii) Find the total money he saved.
OR
If 6 times the 6th term of an A.P., is equal to 9 times the 9th term, find its 15th term.
Ans: Child's savings day wise are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ....... to n days
We can have at most 190 coins
i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .... to n term = 190
n
⇒ [2  1  ( n  1)1]  190
2
⇒ n(n + 1) = 380 ⇒ n2 + n - 380 = 0
⇒ (n + 20)(n−19) = 0 ⇒ (n + 20)(n - 19) = 0
⇒ n = −20 or n = 19
But number of coins cannot be negative
n = 19 (rejecting n = -20)
So, number of days = 19
Total money she saved = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + ...
= 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + ... upto 19 terms
19

OR
Let, the first term of A.P. be ‘a’ and its common difference be ‘d’
Given, 6a6 = 9a9
⇒ 6(a + 5d) = 9(a + 8d)
⇒ 6a + 30d = 9a + 72d
⇒ -3a = 42d
⇒ a = -14d
…(i)
Then, 15th term i.e. a15 = a + 14d = -14d + 14d [from (i)]
=0
Hence, 15th term of A.P. is 0.

(a) 256 cm²
(b) 128 cm²
(c) 64√2 cm²
(d) 64 cm²
Ans: (b) 128 cm²
Radius of circle =8 cm
⇒ Diameter = 8 × 2=16 cm
The diameter of circle = diagonal of square =16 cm = a√2
⇒ a = 16/√2 = 8√2
Area of square = (side)2 = (8√2)2 = 128 cm2

21. The length of the minute hand of a clock is 14 cm. Find the area swept by the minute hand in 5
minutes.
Ans: We know that the minute hand completes one rotation in 1 hour or 60 minutes.
Length of the minute hand (r) = 14 cm
Area swept by minute hand in 1 minute = πr2/60
Thus, area swept by minute hand in 5 minutes = (πr2/60) × 5 = πr2/12
= 1/12 × 22/7 × 14 × 14 cm2
= 154/3 cm2

26. The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also 9 times this number is twice the number
obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.
Ans: Let the tens digits and unit digit of the number be x and y respectively. Then, the number
will be 10x + y
Number after reversing the digits is 10y + x
According to the question,
x + y = 9... (i)
9(10x + y) = 2(10y + x)
⇒ 88x – 11y = 0 ⇒ 8x + y = 0... (ii)
Adding equation (i) and (ii), we get
9x = 9 ⇒ x = 1
Putting the value in equation (i), we get y = 8
Hence, the number is 18.

According to the question,
3x – y = 40
….(i)
and, 2x – y = 25
….(ii)
On subtraction, we get: x = 15
putting the value of x in (i), we get 3 (15)-y = 40 y = 5
Number of right answers= 15 answers
Number of wrong answers= 5 answers.
Total Number of questions = 5 + 15 = 20
27. Prove that (sinA + cosecA)2 + (cosA + secA)2 = 7 + tan2A + cot2A
Ans: L.H.S = (sinA + cosecA)2 + (cosA + secA)2
=sin2 A + cosec2 A +2sinAcosecA + cos2 A + sec2 A +2cosAsecA
= sin2 A + cos2 A +cosec2 A+sec2 A +2sinA×1/sinA + 2cosA×1/cosA
Since, (sin2 A + cos2 A =1)
(sec2 A =1 + tan2A, cosec2 A = 1 + cot2A)
= 1 + 1 + cot2A +1 + tan2A +2 +2
= 7 + tan2A +cot2A = RHS
28. Prove that √5 is an irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7 -

So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p and
q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
29. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 – 2x – 8 and verify the relationship between the

Ans: Given, f(x)=x2 − 2x – 8
The zeroes of f(x) are given by, f(x) = 0
⇒ x2 + 2x − 4x – 8 = 0 ⇒ x (x + 2) − 4(x + 2) = 0 ⇒ (x + 2) (x − 4) = 0

OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90°
⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.

24. In figure, ABCD is a rectangle. Find the values of x and y.

Ans: AB = DC and BC = AD
⇒ x + y = 30 ...(i)
and x – y = 14 ...(ii)
Adding (i) and (ii), we get 2x = 44 ⇒ x = 22
⇒ y = 30 - 22 = 8
Thus, x = 22 and y = 8
25. Find A and B, if sin (A + 2B) = √3/2 and cos (A + B) = 1/2.
Ans: Given : sin (A + 2B) = sin 60°
⇒ A + 2B = 60° ...(i)
cos (A + B) = cos 60°
⇒ A + B = 60° ...(ii)
Subtracting equation (i) and (ii), we get B = 0°
Putting the value of B in equation (ii), we get,
A = 60° – 0° = 60°
So, A = 60° and B = 0°.
OR
If (1 + cos A) (1 – cos A) = 3/4 , find the value of tan A.
Ans: (1 + cos A) (1 – cos A) = 3/4
⇒ 1 – cos²A = 3/4 ⇒ cos²A = 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 ⇒ cosA = ±1/2
Also, 1 – cos²A = 3/4 ⇒ sin²A = 3/4 ⇒ sinA = ±√3/2
⇒ tanA = sinA/cosA = ±√3

Questions 13 to 22 carry 3 marks each.

26. A part of monthly hostel charges in a college is fixed and the remaining depends on the number
of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student ‘A’ takes food for 22 days, he has to
pay Rs. 1380 as hostel charges; whereas a student ‘B’, who takes food for 28 days, pays Rs.
1680 as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
Ans: Let the fixed hostel charges be Rs. x and the cost of food per day be Rs. y.
According to the question, we get
x + 22y = 1380 ...(i)
and x + 28y = 1680 ...(ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get
6y = 300 ⇒ y = 300 ÷ 6 = 50
Putting y = 50 in (i), we get
x + 22(50) = 1380 ⇒ x + 1100 = 1380 ⇒ x = 280
∴ Fixed hostel charges = Rs. 280 and cost of the food per day = Rs. 50.
OR
The ratio of income of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditure is 4 : 3, if each of
them manage to save Rs. 2000/month. Find their monthly incomes.
Ans: Let the income of first person be 9x and the income of second person be 7x. Further, let
the expenditures of first and second persons be 4y and 3y respectively. Then, Saving of the first
person = 9x – 4y
Saving of the second person = 7x – 3y
According to question,
9x – 4y = 2000 or 9x – 4y – 2000 = 0 ...(i)
and 7x – 3y = 2000 or 7x – 3y – 2000 = 0 ...(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x = 2000 and y = 4000
Thus, monthly income of first person = 9 × 2000 = Rs. 18000
Monthly income of second person = 7 × 4000 = Rs. 28000

28. Prove that √5 is and irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p
and q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
29. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial 6x2 – 7x – 3 and verify the relationship between the

30. Prove that the intercept of a tangent between two parallel tangents to a circle subtends a right
angle at the center
Ans: Given: XY and X'Y' are two parallel tangents to the circle wth centre O and AB is the
tangent at the point C, which intersects XY at A and X'Y' at B.

In ΔOAP and ΔOAC
AP = AC ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO = OC ( Radii of the same circle)
OA = OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP = ΔOAC (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠AOP =∠AOC = ∠1 (CPCT)
Similarly, ∠BOQ =∠BOC = ∠2
Now, POQ is a diameter of the circle.
Hence, it is a straight line.
∴ ∠1 + ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠2 = 180°
2(∠1 + ∠2) = 180°
∴ ∠1 + ∠2 = 90°
∴ ∠AOB = 90°.

In ΔOAP and ΔOAS
AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)
OA=OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT)
⇒ ∠1=∠8
Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰
⇒ 2(∠1) + 2(∠2) + 2(∠5) + 2(∠6) = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1) + (∠2) + (∠5) + (∠6) = 180⁰
∴ ∠AOD + ∠COD=180⁰
Similarly, ∠BOC + ∠DOA = 180⁰

36. Anita’s mother start a new shoe shop. To display the shoes, she put 3 pairs of shoes in 1st row, 5
pairs in 2nd row, 7 pairs in 3rd row and so on.

On the basis of above information, answer the following questions.
(i) If she puts a total of 120 pairs of shoes, then find the number of rows required.
(ii) What is the difference of pairs of shoes in 17th row and 10th row.
Ans: Number of pairs of shoes in 1st, 2nd, 3rd row, ... are 3, 5, 7, ...
So, it forms an A.P. with first term a = 3, d = 5 – 3 = 2
(i) Let n be the number of rows required.
∴ Sn = 120 ⇒ (n/2) [2(3) + (n − 1)2] = 120
⇒ n2 + 2n – 120 = 0 ⇒ n2 + 12n – 10n – 120 = 0
⇒ (n + 12) (n – 10) = 0 ⇒ n = 10

So, 10 rows required to put 120 pairs.
(ii) No. of pairs in 17th row = a17 = 3 + 16(2) = 35
No. of pairs in 10th row = a10 = 3 + 9(2) = 21

37. A 1.2 m tall girl spots a balloon moving with the wind in a horizontal line at a height of 88.2 m
from the ground. The angle of elevation of the balloon from the eyes of the girl at any instant is
60°. After 30 seconds, the angle of elevation reduces to 30° (see the below figure).

Based on the above information, answer the following questions. (Take √3 =1.732)
(i) Find the distance travelled by the balloon during the interval.
(ii) Find the speed of the balloon.
Ans: (i) In the figure, let C be the position of the observer (the girl).
A and P are two positions of the balloon.
CD is the horizontal line from the eyes of the (observer) girl.
Here PD = AB = 88.2 m − 1.2 m = 87 m

Thus, the required distance between the two positions of the balloon = 58 √3 m
= 58 x 1.73 = 100.46 m (approx.)
(ii) Speed of the balloon = Distance/time = 100.46/30 = 3.35 m/s (approx.)

take a position at a particular place. There are two reasons to set a cricket field—to take wickets
and to stop runs being scored.
The following graph shows the position of players during a cricket match.
(i) Find the coordinate of the point on y-axis which are equidistant from the points representing
the players at Cover P(2, –5) and Mid-wicket Q(–2, 9)
(ii) Find the ratio in which x-axis divides the line segment joining the points Extra Cover S(3, –
3) and Fine Leg (–2, 7).

Ans: (i) Let A (0, y) be any point on the y-axis.
Since A (0, y) is equidistant from P (2, –5) and Q (–2, 9)
So AP = AQ ⇒ AP2 = AQ2
⇒ (2)2 + (y + 5)2 = (2)2 + (y – 9)2 ⇒ y2 + 10 y + 25 = y2 – 18y + 81
⇒ 28y = 81 – 25 ⇒ 28y = 56
⇒ y = 28/56 = 2
So, the point is (0, 2)
(ii) Let point P(x, 0) divides the line segment joining the points A and B in the ratio k : 1

Hence, the point P divides the line segment in the ratio 3 : 7.

11. In the given figure, PA and PB are tangents to the circle with centre O. If ∠APB = 60°, then
∠OAB is

(a) 30°
(b) 60°
(c) 90°
(d) 15°
Ans: (a) 30°
PA = PB ( Tangents drawn from external point are equal)
⇒ ∠ABP = ∠BAP = x ( Angles opposite to equal sides are equal)
In ∆APB, 60° + x + x = 180°
⇒ 2x = 120° ⇒ x = 60°
Now, ∠OAP = 90° (∵ Tangent is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact)
∴ ∠OAB = 90° – 60° = 30°

and CE = CF = z cm

Now, x + y = AB = 10 cm
y + z = BC = 12 cm
z + x = CA = 8 cm
Adding all we get 2(x+ y +z) = 30 ⇒ x + y + z = 15
Subtracting, we get z = 5 cm, x = 3 cm and y = 7 cm
Hence, AD = 3 cm, BE = 7 cm and CF = 5 cm.
25. The length of the minute hand of a clock is 6cm. Find the area swept by it when it moves from

Ans: We know that, in 60 minutes, the tip of minute hand moves 360°
In 1 minute, it will move = 360°/60 = 6°
∴ From 5:25 pm to 6:00 pm i.e. 35 min, it will move through = 35 × 6° = 210°
∴ Area of swept by the minute hand in 35 min = Area of sector with sectorial angle θ of 210°

km/hr; it would have taken 6 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the
journey.
Ans: Let the actual speed of the train be x km/hr and let the actual time taken be y hours.
Distance covered is xy km If the speed is increased by 6 km/hr, then time of journey is reduced
by 4 hours i.e., when speed is (x+6)km/hr, time of journey is (y−4) hours.
∴ Distance covered = (x + 6)(y − 4)
⇒ xy = (x + 6)(y − 4) ⇒ −4x + 6y − 24 = 0 ⇒ −2x + 3y −12 = 0
………….(i)
Similarly xy = (x − 6)(y + 6) ⇒ 6x − 6y − 36 = 0 ⇒ x − y − 6 = 0
…………(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii) we get x=30 and y=24
Putting the values of x and y in equation (i), we obtain
Distance = (30 × 24)km =720km.
Hence, the length of the journey is 720km.

Anuj had some chocolates, and he divided them into two lots A and B. He sold the first lot at the
rate of ₹2 for 3 chocolates and the second lot at the rate of ₹1 per chocolate, and got a total of
₹400. If he had sold the first lot at the rate of ₹1 per chocolate, and the second lot at the rate of
₹4 for 5 chocolates, his total collection would have been ₹460. Find the total number of
chocolates he had.
Ans: Let the number of chocolates in lot A be x
And let the number of chocolates in lot B be y
∴ total number of chocolates =x+y
2
Price of 1 chocolate = ₹ 2/3 , so for x chocolates = x
3
and price of y chocolates at the rate of ₹ 1 per chocolate =y.
2
∴ by the given condition x + y = 400 ⇒ 2x + 3y = 1200 ..............(i)
3
4
Similarly, x + y = 460 ⇒ 5x + 4y = 2300 ........ (ii)
5
Solving (i) and (ii) we get x = 300 and y = 200
∴ x + y = 300 + 200 = 500
So, Anuj had 500 chocolates.

Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0,
RHS of equation (i) is rational.
But LHS of (i) is √5 which is irrational. This is not possible.
This contradiction has arisen due to our wrong assumption that 2 + 3√5 is rational.

(i) At least one head?
(ii) At most one tail?
(iii) A head and a tail?
Ans: Total number of outcomes = 4
(i) Number of outcomes with at least one head = 3
∴ Required probability = 3/4
(ii) Number of outcomes with at most one tail = 3
∴ Required probability = 3/4
(iii)Number of outcomes with a head and a tail = 2
∴ Required probability = 2/4 = 1/2
31. Prove that a parallelogram circumscribing a circle is a rhombus
Ans: We have ABCD, a parallelogram which circumscribes a circle (i.e., its sides touch the
circle) with centre O.
Since tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length,
∴ AP = AS, BP = BQ, CR = CQ and DR = DS
Adding, we get
(AP + BP) + (CR + DR) = (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
⇒ AB + CD = AD + BC
But AB = CD [opposite sides of ABCD]
and BC = AD
∴ AB + CD = AD + BC ⇒ 2 AB = 2 BC
⇒ AB = BC
Similarly AB = DA and DA = CD
Thus, AB = BC = CD = AD
Hence ABCD is a rhombus.

AB with point of contact C interesting XY at A and X'Y' at B, what is the measure of ∠AOB.

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC

In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.

33. A cubical block of side 10 cm is surmounted by a hemisphere. What is the largest diameter that
the hemisphere can have? Find the cost of painting the total surface area of the solid so formed,
at the rate of Rs. 5 per 100 sq. cm. [Use π = 3.14]
Ans: Side of the cubical block (l) = 10 cm.

The hemisphere is surmounted on it.
The largest diameter the hemisphere can have =
side of the cubical block
Diameter of the hemisphere = 10 cm
Radius of the hemisphere (r) = 5 cm
Total surface area of the solid formed
= TSA of the cubical + CSA of the hemisphere - Area of the base of the hemisphere
= 6l2 + 2πr2 – πr2 = 6l2 + πr2
= 6 × (10)2 + 3.14 × (5)2
= 6 × 100 + 3.14 × 25
= 600 + 78.50
= 678.5 cm2
Rate of painting = Rs. 5 per 100 cm2
Cost pf painting the solid formed = Rs. 5/100 × 678.5
= Rs. 33.925 = Rs. 33.93 (approx)

Due to heavy floods in a state, thousands were rendered homeless. 50 schools collectively
decided to provide place and the canvas for 1500 tents and share the whole expenditure equally.
The lower part of each tent is cylindrical with base radius 2.8 m and height 3.5 m and the upper
part is conical with the same base radius, but of height 2.1 m. If the canvas used to make the
tents costs ₹120 per m2, find the amount shared by each school to set up the tents.
Ans: Radius of the base of cylinder (r) = 2.8 m = Radius of the base of the cone (r)
Height of the cylinder (h)=3.5 m
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Height of the cone (H)=2.1 m.
Slant height of conical part (l)=√(r2 + H2) = √[(2.8)2 + (2.1)2] = √(7.84 + 4.41) = √12.25 = 3.5 m

⇒ Either x – 5 = 0 or 13x + 24 = 0 ⇒ x = 5 as x = −24/13 not possible.
Hence, the time taken by the two pipes is 5 hours and 8 hours respectively.

Ans: Let the usual speed of plane be x km/hr
and the reduced speed of the plane be (x – 200) km/hr
Distance =600 km [Given]
According to the question,
(time taken at reduced speed) – (Schedule time) = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours.

⇒ x(x – 600) + 400( x – 600) = 0 ⇒ (x – 600)(x + 400) =0
⇒ x = 600 or x = −400
But speed cannot be negative.
∴ The usual speed is 600 km/hr and
the scheduled duration of the flight is 600/600 =1hour

The school auditorium was to be constructed to accommodate at least 1500 people. The chairs
are to be placed in concentric circular arrangement in such a way that each succeeding circular
row has 10 seats more than the previous one.

(i) If the first circular row has 30 seats, how many seats will be there in the 10th row? (1)
(ii) For 1500 seats in the auditorium, how many rows need to be there? (2)
OR
If 1500 seats are to be arranged in the auditorium, how many seats are still left to be put after
10th row? (2)
(iii) If there were 17 rows in the auditorium, how many seats will be there in the middle row?(1)
Ans: (i) Since each row is increasing by 10 seats, so it is an AP with first term a = 30, and
common difference d =10. So number of seats in 10th row = 10 = a + 9d
= 30 + 9 ×10 = 120

38. Case Study – 3:
A lighthouse is a tall tower with light near the top. These are often built on islands, coasts or on cliffs.
Lighthouses on water surface act as a navigational aid to the mariners and send warning to boats and ships
for dangers. Initially wood, coal would be used as illuminators. Gradually it was replaced by candles,
lanterns, electric lights. Nowadays they are run by machines and remote monitoring. Prongs Reef lighthouse
of Mumbai was constructed in 1874-75. It is approximately 40 meters high and its beam can be seen at a
distance of 30 kilometres. A ship and a boat are coming towards the lighthouse from opposite directions.
Angles of depression of flash light from the lighthouse to the boat and the ship are 300 and 600 respectively.

26. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that (2 + 5√3) is an irrational number.
Ans: Let 2 + 5√3 be a rational number such that
2 + 5√3 = a, where a is a non-zero rational number.
a2
5 3  a2  3 
5
a2
Since 5 and 2 are integers and a is a rational number, therefore
is a rational number

⇒ √3 is a rational number which contradicts the fact that √3 is an irrational number.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence 2 + 5√3 is an irrational number
27. Find the zeroes of the polynomial x2 + x – 2, and verify the relation between the coefficients and
the zeroes of the polynomial.

1
(6x2 + x − 12)
6
On factoring, 6x² + x – 12 = 6x² + 9x – 8x – 12
= 3x(2x + 3) - 4(2x + 3)
= (3x - 4)(2x + 3)
So, 1/6 (6x² + 6x - 12) = 0
(3x - 4)(2x + 3) = 0
3x - 4 = 0 ⇒ 3x = 4 ⇒ x = 4/3
2x + 3 = 0 ⇒ 2x = -3 ⇒ x = -3/2
Therefore, the zeros of the polynomial are 4/3 and -3/2.
Sum of the roots:
LHS: + ꞵ =4/3 + (-3/2) = 8 - 9/6 = -1/6
RHS: -coefficient of x/coefficient of x² = -1/6
Product of the roots
LHS: ꞵ = (4/3)(-3/2) = -12/6 = -2
RHS: constant term/coefficient of x² = -12/6 = -2.
Ans: The polynomial can be rewritten as

28. A number consists of two digits. Where the number is divided by the sum of its digits, the quotient
is 7. If 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange their places, find the number.
Ans : Let digit at unit place be x, and at tenth place be y.
∴ Number = 10y + x
10 y  x
 7 ⇒ 6x – 3y = 0
According to the question,
yx
⇒ 2x – y = 0 ...(i)
Again according to the question, (10y + x) – 27 = 10x + y
⇒ 9x – 9y = – 27 ⇒ x – y = – 3 ...(ii)
Solving for x and y, we get
x = 3 and y = 6
∴ Number is 63.

Students of a class are made to stand in rows. If 4 students are extra in a row, there would be two
rows less. If 4 students are less in a row, there would be four more rows. Find the number of
students in the class.
Ans : Let number of students in a row be x and number of rows be y.
⇒ Total number of students = x . y
From condition 1 : (x + 4) (y – 2) = xy
⇒ xy – 2x + 4y – 8 = xy – 2x + 4y = 8 ...(i)
From condition 2 : (x – 4) (y + 4) = xy xy + 4x – 4y – 16 = xy
⇒ 4x – 4y = 16 ...(ii)
Adding (i) and (ii), we get 2x = 24 ⇒ x = 12
Substituting in (i), we get y = 8.
∴ Total number of students = xy = 12 × 8 = 96.

30. A circle is inscribed in a ∆ABC having sides 16 cm, 20 cm and 24 cm as shown in figure. Find AD,
BE and CF.

Ans: Since, tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
∴ AD = AF = x (say)
BD = BE = y (say)
CE = CF = z (say)
According to the question,
AB = x + y = 24 cm ...(i)
BC = y + z = 16 cm ...(ii)
AC = x + z = 20 cm ...(iii)
Subtracting (iii) from (i), we get
y – z = 4 ...(iv)
Adding (ii) and (iv), we get
2y = 20 ⇒ y = 10 cm
Substituting the value of y in (i) and (ii), we get
x = 14 cm, z = 6 cm
Hence, AD = 14 cm, BE = 10 cm and CF = 6 cm.
OR

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7 -

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC
In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)

Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.
31. Two dice are thrown at the same time. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers
appearing on the top of the dice is
(i) at least 9?
(ii) 7?
(iii) less than or equal to 6?
Ans: (i) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers is at least 9 = 10
∴ Required Probability = 10/36 = 5/18
(ii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers 7 = 6
∴ Required Probability = 6/36 = 1/6
(iii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers less than or equal to 6 = 36
∴ Required Probability = 15/36 = 5/12

⇒ x – 20 = 0 or x + 24 = 0 ⇒ x = 20 or x = -24
Since the number of days cannot be negative. So, x = 20
Therefore, the original duration of the tour was 20 days
OR
Rs.6500 were divided equally among a certain number of persons. Had there been 15 more persons,
each would have got Rs.30 less. Find the original number of persons.
Ans: Let the original number of persons be x
Total money which was divided = Rs. 6500
Each person share = Rs. 6500/x
6500 x  97500  6500 x
6500 6500
 30
According to the question,

 30 
x

x ( x  15)
97500
3250

 30 
 1 ⇒ x² + 15x – 3250 = 0
x ( x  15)
x( x  15)
⇒ x² + 65x – 50x – 3250 = 0 ⇒ x(x + 65) – 50(x + 65) = 0
⇒ (x + 65)(x – 50) = 0 ⇒ x = -65, 50
Since the number of persons cannot be negative, hence the original numbers of person is 50

produce 1800 cars in 4th year and 2600 cars in 8th year. Assuming that the production increases
uniformly by a fixed number every year.

Based on the above information answer the following questions.
(i) Find the production in the 1st year.
(1)
(ii) Find the production in the 12th year.
(1)
(iii) Find the total production in first 10 years. (2)
OR
(iii) In how many years will the total production reach 31200 cars?

(2)

Ans: (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, the number of Cars
manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . .,years will form an AP.
So, a + 3d = 1800 & a + 7d = 2600
So d = 200 & a = 1200
(ii) a12 = a + 11d ⇒ a30 = 1200 + 11 × 200
⇒ a12 = 3400

  200[12  ( n  1)]  31200
2
⇒ n[12 + (n − 1) ] = 312
⇒ n2 + 11n – 312 = 0
⇒ n2 + 24n – 13n – 312 = 0
⇒ (n +24)(n – 13) = 0
⇒ n = 13 or – 24.
As n can’t be negative. So n = 13

A lighthouse is a tall tower with light near the top. These are often built on islands, coasts or on cliffs.
Lighthouses on water surface act as a navigational aid to the mariners and send warning to boats and ships
for dangers. Initially wood, coal would be used as illuminators. Gradually it was replaced by candles,
lanterns, electric lights. Nowadays they are run by machines and remote monitoring. Prongs Reef lighthouse
of Mumbai was constructed in 1874-75. It is approximately 40 meters high and its beam can be seen at a
distance of 30 kilometres. A ship and a boat are coming towards the lighthouse from opposite directions.
Angles of depression of flash light from the lighthouse to the boat and the ship are 300 and 600 respectively.

26. A man wished to give Rs. 12 to each person and found that he fell short of Rs. 6 when he wanted to
give to all the persons present. He, therefore, distributed Rs. 9 to each person and found that Rs. 9
were left over. How much money did he have and how many persons were there?
Ans. Let, number of persons = x
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 5-

Money share per person = y
Therefore, total money = Rs. xy
According to the question, 12 × x = xy + 6 ⇒ 12x – 6 = xy ...(i)
and 9x = xy – 9
9x + 9 = xy ...(ii)
Equating (i) and (ii), we get
12x – 6 = 9x + 9 ⇒ 3x = 15
Put the value of x in equation (i). Then
12 × 5 – 6 = x × y ⇒ xy = 54
So, he have Rs. 54 and there were 5 persons.
OR
A father’s age is three times the sum of the ages of his children. After 5 years, his age will be two
times the sum of their ages. Find the present age of the father.
Ans. Let the sum of the ages of two children be 'x' years and father's age be 'y' years.
According to the given condition: y = 3x
or y – 3x = 0 ...(i)
After 5 years, Father’s age = (y + 5) years
Sum of the ages of children = (x + 5 + 5) years.
Then, y + 5 = 2(x + 10)
or y – 2x – 15 = 0 ...(ii)
On subtracting equation (i) from equation (ii), we get x = 15
If we put the value of x in equation (i), we get
y – 3 × 15 = 0
⇒ y = 45
Hence, the present age of the father is 45 years.

29. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that 5 + 2√3 is irrational.
Ans: Let us assume 5 + 2√3 is rational, then it must be in the form of p/q where p and q are coprime integers and q ≠0
i.e 5 + 2√3 = p/q
p  5q
So √3 =
…(i)
2q
Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0,
RHS of equation (i) is rational.
But LHS of (i) is √3 which is irrational. This is not possible.
This contradiction has arisen due to our wrong assumption that 5 + 2√3 is rational
So, 5 + 2√3 is irrational.
30. Cards numbered 1 to 30 are put in a bag. A card is drawn at random from this bag. Find the
probability that the number on the drawn card is
(i) not divisible by 3.
(ii) a prime number greater than 7.
(iii) not a perfect square number.
Ans : Total possible outcomes of drawing a card from a bag out of 30 cards = 30.
(i) Favourable outcomes for a card numbered not divisible by 3 = 20 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13,
14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28 and 29).
Probability of drawing a card numbered not divisible by 3 = 20/30 = 2/3
(ii) Favourable outcomes for a prime numbered card greater than 7 = 6 (i.e. 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and
29)
Probability of drawing a prime number card, greater than 7 = 6/30 = 1/5
(iii) Favourable outcomes for not a perfect square numbered card = 25 (leaving 1, 4, 9, 16 and 25)
Probability of drawing a card which is not a perfect square = 25/30 = 5/6

∠PBA = ∠PAB [Angles opposite to the equal sides of a triangle are equal.]
∠APB+ ∠PBA +∠PAB= 180° [Sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°]
x° + ∠PAB +∠PAB = 180° (∠PBA = ∠PAB)
⇒ x° + 2∠PAB = 180°
⇒ ∠PAB =½(180° - x°)
⇒ ∠PAB =90° - x°/2
⇒ ∠OAB +∠PAB=90°
⇒ ∠OAB =90° - (90° - x°/2)
⇒ ∠OAB = x°/2 ⇒ ∠OAB = ∠APB /2 ⇒ ∠APB = 2∠OAB

In ΔOAP and ΔOAS
AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)

so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT) ⇒ ∠1=∠8
Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰
⇒ 2(∠1) + 2(∠2) + 2(∠5) + 2(∠6) = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1) + (∠2) + (∠5) + (∠6) = 180⁰

Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of the base of
the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is
EH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm
So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy

any point on the circle. Then the measure of ∠AQB is

(a) 62½°
(b) 125°
(c) 55°
(d) 90°
Ans: (a) 62½°
∠PAC = 90° (Tangent is perpendicular to the radius through point of contact)
∠PBA = 90°
∠APB = 55° (Given)
So, ∠APB + ∠PAC + ∠PBA + ∠ACB = 360° (Sum of all angles of quadrilaterals is 360°)
∠ACB = 360° – 235° = 125°
∠ACB = 2∠AQB

Questions 21 to 25 carry 2M each
21. Show that 6n cannot end with digit 0 for any natural number 'n'.
Ans: If 6n ends with 0 then it must have 5 as a factor.
But, 6n = (2 × 3)n = 2n × 3n
This shows that 2 and 3 are the only Prime Factors of 6n.
According to Fundamental theorem of arithmetic prime factorization of each number is Unique.
So, 5 is not a factor of 6n
Hence, 6n can never end with the digit 0.
22. Find the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation 2x² – 9x + 4 = 0.
OR
Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 4x² – 5 = 0 and hence comment on the nature of

Product of roots = 4/2 = 2
[For quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, sum of roots = −b/a and product of roots = c/a]
OR
Given quadratic equation is 4x² – 5 =0
∵ discriminant, D = b² – 4ac
⇒ D = 0 – 4(4) (– 5) ⇒ D = 80
Thus, discriminant D = 80

Required probability = 3/4
24. Find the length of the shadow on the ground of a pole of height 18 m when angle of elevation θ of
the sun is such that tanθ = 6/7.
Ans: In right ∆ABC,
tanθ = AB/BC = P/B ...(i)

But tanθ = 6/7 (Given)
Substitute value of tanθ and height of pole AB = 18 m is equation (i)
⇒ 6/7 = 18/BC
⇒ BC = 18 × 7 / 6 = 21 m
Hence, the length of the shadow = 21 m.
OR
If A and B are acute angles such that sin (A – B) = 0 and 2 cos (A + B) – 1 = 0, then find angles A
and B.
Ans: Given sin (A – B) = 0 and 2 cos (A + B) – 1 = 0
sin (A – B) = 0
and 2 cos (A + B) – 1 = 0
⇒ sin (A – B) = sin 0°
and cos (A + B) = 1/2
⇒ A – B = 0° ...(i)
and cos (A + B) = cos 60°
and A + B = 60° ...(ii)
On solving eqs (i) and (ii), we get
A = 30° and B = 30°
25. If one zero of the polynomial p(x) = 6x² + 37x – (k – 2) is reciprocal of the other, then find the
value of k.
Ans: Let the zeroes of polynomials are α and 1/α.
product of zeroes = −(k − 2)/6
⇒ α × 1/α = −(k − 2)/6
⇒ 6 = – (k – 2) ⇒ k = 2 – 6 ⇒ k = – 4
Therefore, value of k is – 4.

OR
Prove that √2 is an irrational number.
p
Ans: Let 2 is a rational number then we have 2  , where p and q are co-primes.
q
 p 2 q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  2q 2
 p2 is divisible by 2  p is also divisible by 2
So, assume p = 2m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 4m2
But p 2  2q 2
Therefore, 2q2 = 4m2  q2 = 2m2
 q2 is divisible by 2  q is also divisible by 2
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 2 which contradicts that p and q
are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 2 is an irrational number.
27. Prove that the angle between the two tangents drawn from an external to circle is supplementary to
the angle subtended by the line joining the points of contact at the centre.
Ans: Given: PA and PB are the tangent drawn from a point P to a circle with centre O Also, the line
segments OA and OB are drawn.
To prove: ∠APB + ∠AOB = 180°

Proof: We know that the tangents to a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the points of
contact.
∴ PA ⊥ OA ⇒ ∠OAP = 90°
and PB ⊥ OB ⇒ ∠OBP = 90°
Therefore, ∠OAP + ∠OBP = 180°
Hence ∠APB + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of the all the angles of a quadrilateral is 360°]

29. Two concentric circles are of radii 5 cm and 3 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle
which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: Let the two concentric circles with centres O. Let AB be the chord of the larger circle which
touches the smaller circle at point P.
Therefore, AB is tangent to the smaller circle to the point P.
∴ OP ⊥ AB

In ∆OPA, AO2 = OP2 + AP2
⇒ (5)2 = (3)2 + AP2
⇒ AP2 = 25 – 9 ⇒ AP = 4 cm
Now, in ∆OPB, OP ⊥ AB
⇒ AP = PB (Perpendicular form the centre of the circle bisects the chord)
Thus, AB = 2AP = 2 × 4 = 8 cm
Hence, length of the chord of the larger circle is 8 cm.
30. The sum of two numbers is 15. If the sum of their reciprocals is 3/10, find the two numbers.

So, 
x 15  x 10
x (15  x) 10
⇒ 15 × 10 = 3x(15 – x)
⇒ 150 = 45x – 3x2
⇒ 3x² – 45x + 150 = 0
⇒ x² – 15x + 50 = 0
⇒ x² – 10x – 5x + 50 = 0
⇒ x(x – 10) – 5 (x – 10) = 0
⇒ (x – 10) (x – 5) = 0
⇒ x = 10, x = 5
If First Number (x) = 10
Other Number (15 – x) = 5
If First Number (x) = 5
Other Number (15 – x) = 10
31. How many terms are there in an A.P. whose first and fifth terms are –14 and 2, respectively and the
last term is 62.
OR
Which term of the A.P.: 65, 61, 57, 53, .................. is the first negative term?
Ans: Given, first term (a) = – 14, fifth term (a5) = 2
and last term (an) = 62 1
Let common difference be d.
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 8-

∴ a5 = a + 4d ⇒ 2 = – 14 + 4d ⇒ d = 4 ...(i) 1
an = a + (n – 1)d
⇒ 62 = – 14 + (n – 1)4 [From eq (i)]
⇒ n – 1 = 19 ⇒ n = 20
Thus, number of terms in A.P. are 20
OR
Given A.P. is 65, 61 57, 53, ...
Here, first term, a = 65
common difference, d = – 4
Let the nth term of the given A.P. be the first negative term.
∴ an < 0 ⇒ a + (n – 1)d < 0
⇒ 65 + (n – 1) (– 4) < 0 ⇒ 69 – 4n < 0 ⇒ – 4n < – 69
⇒ n > 69/4 ⇒ n > 17.25
Since, 18 is the natural number just greater than 17.25
So, n = 18
Hence, 18th term is first negative term.

To prove: CA2 = CB.CD

Proof: In ∆ADC and ∆BAC,
∠ADC = ∠BAC (Given)
∠ACD = ∠BCA (common angle)
∴ ∆ADC ~ ∆BAC (By AA similarly criterion)
We know that, the corresponding sides of similar triangles are in proportion.

From the top of a 7 m high building, the angle of elevation of the top of a cable tower is 60° and the
angle of depression of its foot is 30°. Determine the height of the tower.
Ans: Let AB be the building of height 7 m and EC be the height of the tower.
A is the point from where elevation of tower is 60° and the angle of depression of its foot is 45°.
EC = DE + CD
Also, CD = AB = 7 m and BC = AD

In right ∆ABC, tan 45° = AB/BC
⇒ 1 = 7/BC ⇒ BC = 7
Since, BC = AD
So, AD = 7 m
In right ∆ADE, tan 60° = DE/AD
⇒ √3 = DE/7 ⇒ DE = 7√3 cm
Hence, EC = CD + ED
= 7 + 7√3 = 7(1 + √3) = 7(1 + 1.732)
= 7 × 2.732 = 19.124 m = 19 m
Thus, height of the tower in approximately 19 m.

36. A coaching institute of Mathematics conducts classes in two batches I and II and fees for rich and
poor children are different. In batch I, there are 20 poor and 5 rich children, whereas in batch II,
there are 5 poor and 25 rich children. The total monthly collection of fees from batch I is Rs. 9000
and from batch II is Rs. 26,000. Assume that each poor child pays Rs. x per month and each rich
child pays Rs. y per month.

Based on the above information, answer the following questions:
(i) Represent the information given above in terms of x and y.
(ii) Find the monthly fee paid by a poor child.
OR
Find the difference in the monthly fee paid by a poor child and a rich child.
(iii) If there are 10 poor and 20 rich children in batch II, what is the total monthly collection of fees
from batch II?
Ans: Monthly fees paid by each poor children = ` x
Monthly fees paid by each rich children = ` y
(i) For batch I
20x + 5y = 9000 ...(i)
For batch II
5x + 25y = 26000 ...(ii)
(ii) Multiply equation (i) by 5 we get
100x + 25y = 45000 (iii)
Subtract (ii) from (iii), we get
95x = 19000
⇒ x = 19000/95 = 200
Thus, monthly fee paid by Poor Child = ` 200
OR
Substitute value of x in equation (i)
20 × 200 + 5y = 9000
⇒ 5y = 9000 – 4000
⇒ y = 5000/5 = 1000
Monthly fee paid by Rich child = Rs. 1000
Difference in monthly fee paid by poor child and a rich child = 1000 – 200
= Rs. 800
(iii) Poor children = 10
Rich children = 20

37. Governing council of a local public development authority of Dehradun decided to build an
adventurous playground on the top of a hill, which will have adequate space for parking. After
survey, it was decided to build rectangular playground, with a semi-circular are allotted for parking
at one end of the playground. The length and breadth of the rectangular playground are 14 units and
7 units, respectively. There are two quadrants of radius 2 units on one side for special seats.

Based on the above information, answer the following questions:
(i) What is the total perimeter of the parking area?
(ii) (a) What is the total area of parking and the two quadrants?
OR
(b) What is the ratio of area of playground to the area of parking area?
(iii) Find the cost of fencing the playground and parking area at the rate of Rs. 2 per unit.
Ans: (i) Radius of semi-circle (r) = 7/2 = 3.5 units
Circumference of semi-circle = πr = 22/7 × 3.5 = 11 units
∴ Perimeter of parking area
= circumference of semi-circle + diameter of semi-circle
= 11 + 7 = 18 units

Area of parking = 19.25 unit² [from part (ii) a]
∴ Ratio of playground : Ratio of parking area
= 98 : 19.25
= 9800/1925

(b) What is the length of diagonal PR in square PQRS?
(iii) If S divides CA in the ratio K : 1, what is the value of K, where point A is (200, 800) ?
Ans: (i) Coordinates of R = (200, 400)
Coordinates of S = (– 200, 400)
(ii) Since, side of square PQRS = 400
Thus, area of square PQRS = (side)²

k[x2 – (a + b) x + ab] where k is any real number
k[x2 – (– 8)x + (– 15)] (∵ a + b = (– 5) + (– 3) = – 8 & ab = – 5 × – 3 = 15)
⇒ k(x2 + 8x + 15)
Here k can have any value
Hence, more than 3 polynomials can have the zeroes – 5 and – 3.

(a) 12 cm
(b) 20 cm
(c) 6 cm
Ans: (b) 20 cm
As PQ || BC by using basic proportionality theorem,
AP/PB = AQ/QC
⇒ 4/6 = 8/QC
⇒ QC = 8 × 6 / 4
⇒ QC = 12 cm
Now, AC = AQ + QC = 8 + 12 = 20 cm

(d) 14 cm

11. In the given figure, PQ is a tangent to the circle with centre O. If ∠OPQ = x, ∠POQ = y, then x + y
is:

drawn is not an ace is:
(a) 1/13
(b) 9/13
(c) 4/13
(d) 12/13
Ans: (d) 12/13
No. of ace cards in a pack of 52 cards = 4
∴ No. of non-ace cards in a pack of 52 cards = 48
Required probability = 48/52 = 12/13
14. If θ is an acute angle of a right angled triangle, then which of the following equation is not true?
(a) sinθ cotθ = cosθ
(b) cosθ tanθ = sinθ
(c) cosec²θ – cot²θ = 1
(d) tan²θ – sec²θ = 1
Ans: (d) tan²θ – sec²θ = 1
For the given acute angle (θ), 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
So, sec²θ – tan²θ = 1 but in option (d) is incorrect
Hence, option (d) is false.
15. If the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x² + (a + 1)x + b are 2 and – 3, then
(a) a = – 7, b = – 1
(b) a = 5, b = – 1
(c) a = 2, b = – 6
(d) a = 0, b = – 6
Ans: (d) a = 0, b = – 6
Zeroes of Quadratic Polynomial x² + (a + 1)x + b are 2 and – 3
∴ α = 2 and β = – 3
Then, Sum of zeroes (α + β) = (2 + (– 3) = – 1
Product of zeroes (αβ) = 2 × – 3 = – 6
∴ Quadratic Polynomial is x² – (α + β)x + αβ = 0
⇒ x² + 1x – 6 = 0 ...(ii)
From Equation (i) and (ii), a + 1 = 1 ⇒ a = 0 and b = – 6
16. If the sum of the first n terms of an A.P. be 3n² + n and its common difference is 6, then its first
term is
(a) 2
(b) 3
(c) 1
(d) 4
Ans: (d) 4
Sn = 3n² + n and d = 6
Substituting n = 1, we get
S1 = 3(1)² + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
⇒ a=4
Thus, first term = 4.

According to Trigonometry Identity, cosec2θ – cot2θ = 1
∴ (cosecθ + cotθ)(cosecθ – cotθ) = 1
⇒ (cosecθ – cotθ) = 1/(cosecθ + cotθ)
or (cosecθ + cotθ) = 1/(cosecθ – cotθ)
∴ Assertion is True.
Reason : It is a Trigonometric Identity which is used in Assertion

In Quadratic Equation with rational coefficient, irrational roots occur in conjugate pairs.
∴ If one root = 5 + √7 then second root = 5 − √7
Hence, Assertion is True and Reason is also true and correct explanation.
SECTION-B
Questions 21 to 25 carry 2M each
21. Two number are in the ratio 2 : 3 and their LCM is 180. What is the HCF of these numbers?
Ans: We know that, LCM × HCF = a × b (a, b are two numbers) ...(i)
Let numbers = 2x and 3x
∴ LCM = 2 × 3 × x = 6x
⇒ 6x = 180 ⇒ x = 30
Numbers are: 2 × 30 = 60 and 3 × 30 = 90
From eq (i), 180 × HCF = 60 × 90
HCF = 60 × 90 /180 = 30
Hence, HCF = 30
OR

secant to the circle with BC as diameter. If ∠AOC = 130°, then find the measure of ∠APB, where O
is the centre of the circle.

Ans: We know that the tangent at a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius passing through
the point of contact.
∴ ∠OAP = 90°
Now, ∠AOC + ∠AOB = 180° (Linear pair)
⇒ ∠AOP = 50°
In ∆PAO, ∠APO + ∠PAO + ∠AOP = 180° (Sum of all angles of a triangle is 180°)
⇒ ∠APO = 180° – (∠PAO + ∠AOP)
= 180° – (90° + 50°) = 40°.

Ans: For equal roots, discriminant = 0
i.e., b2 – 4ac = 0 …(i)
Given equation is px(x – 2) + 6 = 0
i.e., px2 – 2px + 6 = 0
here, a = p, b = – 2p and c = 6 (On comparing with ax2 + bx + c = 0)
From eq, (i) (– 2p)2 – 4(p)(6) = 0
⇒ 4p2 – 24p = 0 ⇒ 4p2 = 24p ⇒ p2 = 6p
⇒ p2 – 6p = 0 ⇒ p(p – 6) = 0 ⇒ p = 0 or p = 6
⇒ p = 6 (Since, If p = 0, then given equation is not quadratic equation)
OR
If α and β are roots of the quadratic equation x² – 7x + 10 = 0, find the quadratic equation whose
roots are α² and β².
Ans: For Given Quadratic Equation

⇒ x² – 5x – 2x + 10 = 0
⇒ x(x – 5) – 2(x – 5) = 0
⇒ (x – 5)(x – 2) = 0 ⇒ x = 5 and x = 2
∴ α = 5 and β = 2
Thus α² = 25 and β² = 4
Quadratic Equation whose roots are α² and β²

30. Prove that √5 is and irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p and q
are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.

32. The ratio of the 11th term to the 18th term of an A.P. is 2 : 3. Find the ratio of the 5th term to the
21st term. Also, find the ratio of the sum of first 5 terms to the sum of first 21 terms.
Ans: Let First term = a
Common difference = d
a11 2
a  10d 2
 
 (∵ a11 = a + 10d and a18 = a + 17d)
a18 3
a  17 d 3
⇒ 3a + 30d = 2a + 34d
⇒ a = 4d ...(i)
S
a  4d
Ratio of 5th term to 21st term is 5 
S 21 a  20d
Substitute value of a = 4d from (i) we get

Hence a5 : a21 = 1 : 3
S5 : S21 = 5 : 49
OR
If the sum of first 6 terms of an A.P. is 36 and that of the first 16 terms is 256, find the sum of first
10 terms.
n
Ans: We know that S n  [2a  (n  1)d ]
2
Now, S6 = 36 (Given)
6
 [2a  (6  1)d ]  36
2
⇒ 2a + 5d = 12 ...(i)
Also, S16 = 256 (Given)
16
 [2a  (16  1)d ]  256
2
⇒ 2a + 15d = 32 ...(ii)
Subtract (i) from (ii), we get
10d = 20 ⇒ d = 2
Substitute d = 2 in equation (i)
2a + 5 × 2 = 12
⇒ 2a = 12 – 10 ⇒ 2a = 2 ⇒ a = 1
Thus, the sum of first 10 terms of AP
10
S10 = [2  1  (10  1)  2] = 5(2 + 18) = 5 × 20 = 100

33. Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn to a circle with centre O from an external point T (see below
left figure). Prove that ∠PTQ = 2 ∠OPQ.

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 11-

Ans: Given: TP = TQ (Two tangents from external point T are equal)
To Prove: ∠PTQ = 2∠OPQ
Proof: Let ∠PTQ = x
TP = TQ (Given)
∴ ∠TPQ = ∠TQP
In ∆TPQ, ∠TPQ + ∠TPQ + ∠PTQ = 180°
⇒ 2∠TPQ + x = 180°
⇒ ∠TPQ = (180°− x)/2
∠TPQ = 90°− (x/2) ...(i)
Now, OP is radius
∴ ∠OPT = 90° (Tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through point of
contact.)
⇒ ∠OPQ + ∠QPT = 90°
⇒ ∠OPQ = 90° – ∠QPT
⇒ ∠OPQ = 90° − [90°− (x/2)] (From (i))
⇒ ∠OPQ = 90° − 90°+ (x/2)
⇒ ∠OPQ = x/2
⇒ 2∠OPQ = x
⇒ ∠PTQ = 2∠OPQ (∵ ∠PTQ = x)
OR
A circle touches the side BC of a ∆ABC at a point P and touches AB and AC when produced at Q
1
and R respectively (see above right sided figure). Show that AQ = (Perimeter of ∆ABC).
2
Ans: Lengths of tangents drawn from an external point
to a circle are equal.
∴ AQ = AR ...(i) (Tangents from A)
BP = BQ ...(ii) (Tangents from B)
CP = CR ...(iii) (Tangents from C) 2
Perimeter of ∆ABC = AB + BC + AC
= AB + BP + PC + AC
= AB + BQ + CR + AC [Using (ii) and (iii)]
= AQ + AR
= 2AQ [From (i)]
1
∴ AQ = × Perimeter of ∆ABC.

Find the value of x and also, find the median and mean expenditure on milk.
Ans: We have, 24 + 40 + 33 + x + 30 + 22 + 16 + 7 = 200 [∵ Total no. of families = 200]
⇒ x + 172 = 200 ⇒ x = 28

35. A student was asked to make a model shaped like a cylinder with two cones attached to its ends by
using a thin aluminium sheet. The diameter of the model is 3 cm and its total length is 12 cm. If
each cone has a height of 2 cm, find the volume of air contained in the model.
Ans: Here, Height of cylinder = 12 – 4 = 8 cm

Radius of cone/cylinder = 3/2 = 1.5 cm
Height of cone = 2 cm
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 13-

Volume of cylinder = πr2h
= π(1.5)2 × 8 = 18π cm3
Volume of cone = 1/3 πr2h
= 1/3 π(1.5)2 × 2
= 1.5π cm3
Total volume = Volume of cylinder + (Volume of cone) × 2
= 18π + 1.5π × 2 = 18π + 3π
= 21π = 21 × 22/7 = 66 cm3.
SECTION-E (Case Study Based Questions)
Questions 36 to 38 carry 4M each
36. Two schools 'P' and 'Q' decided to award prizes to their students for two games of Hockey Rs. x per
student and Cricket Rs. y per student. School 'P' decided to award a total of Rs. 9,500 for the two
games to 5 and 4 students respectively; while school 'Q' decided to award Rs. 7,370 for the two
games to 4 and 3 students respectively.

Based on the above information, answer the
following questions:
(i) Represent the following information algebraically (in terms of x and y).
(ii) (a) What is the prize amount for hockey?
(b) Prize amount on which game is more and by how much?
OR
(iii) What will be the total prize amount if there are 2 students each from two games ?
Ans: (i) Given Rs. x and Rs. y are the prize money per student for Hockey and Cricket,
respectively.
∴ 5x + 4y = 9500 ...(i)
and 4x + 3y = 7370 ...(ii)
(ii) (a) On multiplying eq (i) by 4 and eq (ii) by 5 then subtracting, we get y = 1150
On substituting value of y in equation (i), we get
5x + 4(1150) = 9500
⇒ 5x + 4600 = 9500 ⇒ 5x = 4900 ⇒ x = 980
Thus, prize money for Hockey is Rs. 980.
OR
(b) From part (a),
Prize money for Hockey = Rs. 980
Prize money for Cricket = Rs. 1150
Difference between prize money = Rs. (1150 – 980) = Rs. 170
Thus, prize money is Rs. 170 more for cricket in comparison to Hockey.
(iii) Total prize money = 2 (Prize money for Hockey + Prize money for Cricket)
= 2(980 + 1150) = 2 × 2130 = Rs. 4260

37. "Eight Ball" is a game played on a pool table with 15 balls numbered 1 to 15 and a "cue ball" that is
solid and white. Of the 15 numbered balls, eight are solid (non-white) coloured and numbered 1 to
8 and seven are striped balls numbered 9 to 15.

The 15 numbered pool balls (no cue ball) are placed in a large bowl and mixed, then one ball is
drawn out at random.
Based on the above information, answer the following question:
(i) What is the probability that the drawn ball bears number 8?
(ii) What is probability that the drawn ball bears an even number?
OR
What is the probability that the drawn ball bears a number, which is a multiple of 3?
(iii) What is the probability that the drawn ball is a solid coloured and bears an even number?
Ans: (i) Total number of balls = 15
Number of Ball bears number 8 = 1
∴ P(Getting ball bears number 8) = 1/15
(ii) Number of balls having even numbers = 7
∴ P(Getting even number balls) = 7/15
OR
Number of balls bearing a number, which is multiple of 3 = 5
∴ P(Getting balls having multiple of 3) = 5/15 = 1/3
(iii) Solid coloured balls = 8
Number of solid coloured balls having an even number = 4.
∴ P(Getting Solid Coloured even number Ball) = 4/15

1. If the coordinates of one end of a diameter of a circle are (2, 3) and the coordinates of its centre are
(-2, 5), then the coordinates of the other end of the diameter are
(a) (0, 8)
(b) (0, 4)
(c) (6, -7)
(d)(-6, 7)
Ans: (d) (-6, 7)
2. The perimeter of a triangle with vertices (0, 4), (0, 0) and (3, 0) is
(a) 5
(b) 12
(c) 11
(d) 7 + √5
Ans: (b) 12
Let A(0, 4), B(0, 0), and C(3, 0) be the vertices of a triangle ABC.
Perimeter of the triangle = AB + BC + CA
Using the distance formula,
AB = √[(0)2 + (4)2] = √16 = 4
BC = √[(3)2 + (0)2] = √9 = 3
CA = √[(3)2 + (4)2] = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5
Therefore, perimeter = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12
3. A bag has 5 white marbles, 8 red marbles and 4 purple marbles. If we take a marble randomly, then
what is the probability of not getting purple marble?
(a) 0.5
(b) 0.66
(c) 0.08
(d) 0.77
Ans: (d) 0.77
Total number of purple marbles = 4
Total number of marbles in bag = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17
Probability of getting not purple marbles = 13/17 = 0.77
4. In what ratio does the x-axis divide the join of A(2, -3) and B(5, 6)?
(a) 1 : 2
(b) 3 : 5

5. The pairs of equations 9x + 3y + 12 = 0 and 18x + 6y + 26 = 0 have
(a) Unique solution
(b) Exactly two solutions
(c) Infinitely many solutions
(d) No solution
Ans: (d) No solution
Given, 9x + 3y + 12 = 0 and 18x + 6y + 26 = 0
a1/a2 = 9/18 = 1/2
b1/b2 = 3/6 = 1/2
c1/c2 = 12/26 = 6/13
Since, a1/a2 = b1/b2 ≠ c1/c2
So, the pairs of equations are parallel and the lines never intersect each other at any point, therefore
there is no possible solution.
6. If the distance between the points A(2, -2) and B(-1, x) is equal to 5, then the value of x is:
(a) 2
(b) -2
(c) 1
(d) -1
Ans: (a) 2
7. If PA and PB are tangents to the circle with centre O such that ∠APB = 40°, then ∠OAB is equal to

(a) 40°
(b) 30°
(c) 20°
(d) 25°
Ans: (c) 20°
Let ∠OAB = ∠OBA = x [Opposite angles of equal radii are equal]
And ∠AOB = 180° - 40° = 140°
Now, in triangle AOB, ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ x + x + 140° = 180°
⇒ 2x = 40°⇒ x =20°⇒ ∠OAB = 20°
8. The least number that is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 10 (both inclusive) is:
(a) 10
(b) 100
(c) 504
(d) 2520
Ans. (d) 2520
9. The mode and mean is given by 7 and 8, respectively. Then the median is:
(a) 1/13
(b) 13/3
(c) 23/3
(d) 33
Ans: (c) 23/3
Using Empirical formula, Mode = 3Median – 2 Mean
3Median = Mode + 2Mean
Median = (Mode + 2Mean)/3
Median = [7 + 2(8)]/3 = (7 + 16)/3 = 23/3
10. A sphere of diameter 18 cm is dropped into a cylindrical vessel of diameter 36 cm, partly filled with
water. If the sphere is completely submerged then the water level rises by
(a) 4cm

11. If P(E) = 0.07, then what is the probability of ‘not E’?
(a) 0.93
(b) 0.95
(c) 0.89
Ans: (a) 0.93
P(E) + P(not E) = 1
Since, P(E) = 0.05
So, P(not E) = 1 – P(E)
⇒ P(not E) = 1 – 0.07
∴ P(not E) = 0.93

(d) 0.90

12. The roots of quadratic equation 2x2 + x + 4 = 0 are:
(a) Positive and negative (b) Both Positive
(c) Both Negative
Ans: (d) No real roots
Here, a = 2, b = 1, c = 4
D = b2 – 4ac = 1 – 4(2)(4) = 1 – 32 = -31 < 0
Hence the roots are not real

(d) No real roots

13. If two dice are thrown in the air, the probability of getting sum as 3 will be
(a) 2/18
(b) 3/18
(c) 1/18
(d) 1/36
Ans: (c) 1/18
Total number of outcome = 6 x 6 = 36
Sum 3 is possible if we get (1,2) or (2,1) in the dices.
Hence, the probability will be = 2/36 = 1/18
14. The value of (sin 30°+cos 60°)-(sin 60° + cos 30°) is equal to:
(a) 0
(b) 1+2√3
(c) 1-√3
(d) 1+√3
Ans: (c) 1-√3
sin 30° = ½, sin 60° = √3/2, cos 30° = √3/2 and cos 60° = ½
Putting these values, we get:
(½ + ½) - (√3/2 + √3/2)
= 1 – [(2√3)/2]
= 1 – √3

Questions 21 to 25 carry 2M each
21. Find the quadratic polynomial, sum of whose zeroes is 8 and their product is 12. Hence, find the
zeroes of the polynomial.
Ans: Let and be the zeroes of the required polynomial f(x).
Then ( + ) = 8 and
= 12
∴ f(x) = x2 ˗ ( + )x +
⇒ f(x) = x2 ˗ 8x + 12
Hence, required polynomial f(x) = x2 ˗ 8x + 12
∴ f(x) = 0 ⇒ x2 ˗ 8x + 12 = 0
⇒ x2 ˗ (6x + 2x) + 12 = 0

⇒ x2 ˗ 6x ˗ 2x + 12 = 0
⇒ x (x – 6) – 2 (x – 6) = 0
⇒ (x – 2) (x – 6) = 0
⇒ (x – 2) = 0 or (x – 6) = 0
⇒ x = 2 or x = 6
22. A card is drawn at random from a well shuffled pack of 52 cards. Find the probability of getting (i)
a red king (ii) a queen or a jack
Ans: Total number of outcomes = 52
(i) Number of red colour kings = 2
∴ P(getting a red king) = 2/52 = 1/26
(ii) Number of queen or jack in a pack of card = 4 + 4 = 8
∴ P(getting a queen or a jack) = 8/52 = 2/13
23. Two concentric circles are of radii 6.5 cm and 2.5 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger
circle which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: We know that the radius and tangent are perpendicular at their point of contact

In right triangle AOP, AO2 = OP2 + PA2
⇒ (6.5)2 = (2.5)2 + PA2
⇒ PA2 = 36 ⇒ PA = 6 cm
Since, the perpendicular drawn from the centre bisect the chord.
∴ PA = PB = 6 cm
Now, AB = AP + PB = 6 + 6 = 12 cm
Hence, the length of the chord of the larger circle is 12 cm.
OR
From an external point P, tangents PA and PB are drawn to a circle with center O. If CD is the
tangent to the circle at a point E and PA = 14cm, find the perimeter of ∆PCD.
Ans: We know that the length of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

PA = PB= 14 cm (given)
CA = CE and DB = DE
Perimeter of ΔPCD = PC + CD + PD
= PC + (CE + ED) + PD
= PC + (CA + DB) + PD
= (PC + CA) + (DB + PD)
(CA = CE and DB= DE)
= PA + PB
= 14 cm + 14 cm
= 28 cm
Perimeter of ΔPCD. = 28 cm

24. Solve for x and y: 71x + 37y = 253, 37x + 71y = 287
Ans: The given equations are:
71x + 37y = 253 …..(i)
37x + 71y = 287 ……(ii)
On adding (i) and (ii), we get:
108x + 108y = 540
⇒108(x + y) = 540
⇒(x + y) = 5 ……(iii)
On subtracting (ii) from (i), we get:
34x – 34y = -34
⇒34(x – y) = -34
⇒(x – y) = -1 ……(iv)
On adding (iii) from (i), we get:
2x = 5 – 1 = 4
⇒x = 2
On subtracting (iv) from (iii), we get:2y = 5 + 1 = 6 ⇒y = 3
25. Find all possible values of y for which the distance between the points A (2, -3) and B (10, y) is 10
units.
Ans: We know that the distance between two points is given by d  ( x2  x1 )2  ( y2  y1 )2
Given d = 10 units and points are A (2, -3) and B (10, y)

 (10  2)2  ( y  3)2  10  82  ( y  3)2  100

27. Prove that √5 is an irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q
Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p and q
are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
OR
If two positive integers p and q are written as p = a2b3 and q = a3b, a and b are a prime number then.
Verify LCM(p, q) x HCF (p, q) = p x q
Ans: HCF ( p , q )  a 2 b
LCM ( p, q)  a 3b 2
LCM (p, q)  HCF (p, q)  a 5 b3

pq  a 5 b3
Hence, LCM (p, q)  HCF (p, q)  pq

29. A part of monthly hostel charges in a college are fixed and the remaining depends on the number of
days one has taken food in the mess. When a student A takes food for 25days, he has to pay Rs. 4550 as
hostel charges whereas a student B, who takes food for 30 days, pays Rs. 5200 as hostel charges. Find
the fixed charges and the cost of the food per day.
Ans: Let the fixed charges be Rs.x and the cost of food per day be Rs.y.
Then as per the question
x + 25y = 4550 ………(i)
x + 30y = 5200 ……..(ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get
5y = 650 ⇒ y = 650/5 = 130
Now, putting y = 130, we have
x + 25 × 130 = 4550 ⇒x = 4550 – 3250 = 1300
Hence, the fixed charges be Rs. 1300 and the cost of the food per day is Rs.130.

SECTION-E (Case Study Based Questions)
Questions 36 to 38 carry 4M each
36. A pen stand made of wood is in the shape of a cuboid with four conical depressions to hold pens.
The dimensions of the cuboid are 15 cm by 10 cm by 3.5 cm. The radius of each of the depressions
is 0.5 cm and the depth is 1.4 cm.

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 11-

Based on the above information, answer the following questions.
(i) Find the volume of four conical depressions in the entire stand [2]
(ii) Find the volume of wood in the entire stand [2]
OR
(ii) Three cubes each of side 15 cm are joined end to end. Find the total surface area of the resulting
cuboid. [2]
Ans: (i) Dimensions of the cuboid are 15 cm, 10 cm and 3.5 cm.
∴ Volume of the cuboid = 15 × 10 × 35/10 cm3
= 15 × 35 cm3 = 525 cm3
Since each depression is conical with base radius (r) = 0.5 cm and depth (h) = 1.4 cm,
∴ Volume of each depression (cone)

Since there are 4 depressions,
∴ Total volume of 4 depressions

(ii) Volume of the wood in entire stand
= [Volume of the wooden cuboid] − [Volume of 4 depressions]

OR
(ii) New length (l) = 15+15+15 = 45cm,
New breadth (b) = 15cm,
New height (h) = 15cm,
Total surface of the cuboid = 2(lb + bh + hl)
= 2( 45 x 15 + 15 x 15 + 15 x 45) = 2 × 1575 = 3,150 cm2
37. Your elder brother wants to buy a car and plans to take loan from a bank for his car. He repays his
total loan of Rs. 1,18,000 by paying every month starting with the first instalment of Rs. 1000. If he
increases the instalment by Rs. 100 every month.

On the basis of above information, answer the following questions.
(i) What is the amount paid by him in 20th instalment?
(ii) What is the amount paid by him in 30th instalments?
(iii) What is the amount paid by him upto 20 instalments?
OR
What is the amount paid by him upto 30 instalments?
Ans: (i) Since first installment is of Rs. 1000 and he increases the installment by Rs. 100 every
month.
Thus AP is formed
1000, 1100, 1200, ...
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 12-

∴ a = 1000, d = 1100 – 1000 = 100
∴ Amount paid by him in 20th installment, a20 = a + 19d
= 1000 + 19 × 100 = Rs. 2900.
(ii) We have AP 1000, 1100, 1200, ...
∴ a = 1000, d = 1100 – 1000 = 100
∴ Amount paid by him in 30th installment, a30 = a + 29d
= 1000 + 29 × 100 = Rs. 3900.
(iii) We have AP 1000, 1100, 1200, ...
∴ a = 1000, d = 100
n
∴ Amount paid upto 20th installments = S n  [2a  (n  1)d ]

38. 37. Radio towers are used for transmitting a range of communication services including radio and
television. The tower will either act as an antenna itself or support one or more antennas on its
structure. On a similar concept, a radio station tower was built in two Sections A and B. Tower is
supported by wires from a point O.

Distance between the base of the tower and point O is 36 cm. From point O, the angle of elevation
of the top of the Section B is 30° and the angle of elevation of the top of Section A is 45°.
Based on the above information, answer the following questions:
(i) Find the length of the wire from the point O to the top of section B.
(ii) Find the distance AB.
OR
Find the area of ∆OPB.

Maximum Practice after each Chapter
Have conceptual clarity right from the beginning. Refer important CBSE Qs of all
possible typologies (like given in One Shot books) to clear your understanding of
topics. This is a must!
New Competency-based Qs (CBQs)
Form answers based on specific anchor words in each subject: English Gustify,
Comment, Elaborate, Critically Analyse) ; Social Science (Analyse, Justify,
Substantiate) ; Science (Identify, Suggest, Observe)

ke

Focus on Labeling & Spellings
Avoid incorrect spellings (in English) and incomplete labellings (in Science) as it
can result in 0.5 marks deduction. Most common way to lose marks.
Don't distract yourself with excessive resources
Use limited books, videos, coaching's and specially avoid the deluge of ‘free pdfs'
circulated in WhatsApp/telegram groups. Stick to basics and tried and tested
authentic study resources for your class 10 boards.

e

Marking Scheme is Important
CBSE provides Marking Scheme to help understand an ideal answer that CBSE
expects you to write. Refer the CBSE provided Marking scheme always or even the
the marking scheme charts of Educart (based on CBSE Marking scheme).

De

Highlight the Important Points
Underline the important keywords / main points, so that the examiner can
evaluate better in a rush to check. This helps in not losing marks even when you
have written as per the CBSE Marking Scheme.

Q

3-5 marks Qs
Always, read the subjective Qs twice to ensure you understand what (sub-parts) is
(are) asked and what points/keywords you need to write to get full marks (refer
Educart Marking Scheme Charts to make it easy).

&

Formula / Value / Units based Mistakes
Always double check for typos in numerical based Qs / formula or units
representation (mostly Maths & Science) as it leads to losing 0.5 - 1 mark.

4x+/7y=5
x+y=5
Ans.: Let 4x + 7y = 5....(i)
And, x+y = 5....(ii)
y=5-x...(iii)
Substituting the value of y in eq. (i)
4x+/7y=5
4x+7(5-x)=5
4x+35-/7x=5
-3x=5-35
-3x = -30
x=10
Now put the value of x in eq. (iii)
y=5-x
y=5-10=-5
The solution is (x, y) = (10, -5).

Solve the following system by elimination method —
2x + 3y = 8.....(i)
3x + 2y = 7.....(ii)
Ans.: On multiplying eq. (i) by 3 and eq. (ii) by 2
3x (eq.i) -> 3x (2x + 3y = 8) —> 6x + Iy = 24...(iii)
2x (eq.ii) -> 2x (3x + 2y = 7) —> 6x + 4y = 14...(iv)
Subtract eq. (iv) from eq. (iii)
6x + 9y = 24
-(6x + 4y = 14)

Now,

So, our supposition is wrong.

Prime factors of 82 = (23)2= 26
prime factors of 124 = (2 × 2 × 3)4

Now,

36. Given, (7 × 11 × 13) + 13 = 13 (7 × 11 + 1)
= 13 × 78
This number is a multiple of two integers i.e., 13
and 78. Hence, it is a composite number.
Similarly,
(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) + 5 = 5(7 × 6 × 4 × 3 × 2 + 1)
= 5 × 1009
This number is a multiple of two integers i.e., 5
and 1009. Hence, it is a composite number.

Caution

We know that:
“The HCF of any two numbers must be a factor
of the LCM of those numbers.”
So, two numbers cannot have their HCF 18
and LCM 380, as 18 does not divide 380
completely.

39. The given numbers are 12, 15 and 21.
∴

12 = 2 × 2 × 3
= 22 × 3
15 = 3 × 5
21 = 3 × 7
Here, 3 is a common prime factor of the given
numbers and its smallest power is 1.
∴HCF (12, 15, 21) = 3
Now,
LCM = Product of each prime factor

So,

Therefore, 2 divides a2 and so 2 divides a.
So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get
2b2 = 4c2
that is,
b2 = 2c2
This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b
Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a

This contradiction has arisen because of our

Prime factors of 657 = 3 × 3 × 73

HCF = 2 × 11 = 22

LCM of (306, 657) = 2 × 3 × 3 × 17 × 73

Total number of trees = 264

= 22338

264
Total number of rows =

22

Hence, the smallest number divisible by 306
and 657 is 22,338.

63. The time after which the three bells will ring

Now,

LCM = 2 × 2 × 7 = 28
Since, the bells rang at 6 am, so they will again
...(i)

ring together at 6 : 28 am.

64. Let us assume that 5 + 7 is rational

Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ¹ 0,
RHS of equation (i) is rational but LHS of (i) is

Let 5 +

This is not possible. This contradiction has
arisen due to our wrong assumption that

⇒

5 + 2 3 is rational. So, 5  2 3 is irrational.

p and q are integers, ∴ p − 5q is an integer

A = (2r × 3p × 5q)

61. Given,

(i)

B = (2p × 3r × 5p)

(ii)

C = (2q × 3q × 5p)

(iii)

The HCF and LCM of A, B and C from the prime
factorisation
HCF = 2p × 3p × 5p
LCM = 2r × 3r × 5q
According to the question,

7 =

p − 5q
is a rational number
6q
7 is a rational number which is a

contradiction. So, our assumption that
5+

7 is a rational number is wrong

Hence, 5 +

given numbers.

⇒
⇒

(2 × 3 × 5)p = (2 × 3 × 5)1

For this, we find prime factorisation of given
numbers.
40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5
42 = 2 × 3 × 7
45 = 3 × 3 × 5

LCM (40, 42, 45) = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7
= 2520
Hence, each person should walk a minimum
distance of 2520 cm, so that each of them can
cover the same distance in complete steps.

12. (A) As the height of the rocket above the
ground is given by a quadratic polynomial,
p(t) = 24t2 – 41t + 12, its graph will be a
parabola.

(B) The graph intersects the x-axis at two
points.
So, number of zeroes = 2.
(C) To find the zeroes of the given polynomial,
let us factorise the polynomial by splitting
the middle term.
p(t) = 24t2 – 41t + 12
= 24t2 – 32t – 9t + 12
= 8t (3t – 4) – 3(3t – 4)

19. Let k be the number to be added to the given
polynomial. Then the polynomial becomes

x2 – 5x + (4 + k).
As 3 is the zero of the resulting polynomial, we
get

(4 + k) = 15 – 9

9. (A) Given, that the fixed charges are ` x and
running charges are ` y.

Total charges
= Fixed charges + Running charges × 30

From situation 1, for a journey of 10 km,
the charge paid is ` 75, we get
x + 10y = 75

= 19 + 30 × 9
= 19 + 270

...(i)

And for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid
is ` 110
x + 15y = 110

...(ii)

(B) On solving equations (i) and (ii), we get
x = 5 and y = 7
If a person travels 50 km, then
= Fixed charges + Running charges × 50
= 5 + 50 × 7
= 5 + 350
= ` 355
(C) Let the fixed charges be ` p and running
charges be ` q
For a journey of 8 km, the charge paid is ` 91
...(i)

For a journey of 14 km, the charge paid is ` 145
p + 14q = 145

10. (A) Let the number of questions he answered

Then,
x + y = 120
...(i)

y

4x – y = 360
...(ii)
Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get
x = 96
and
y = 24
Hence, he answered 96 questions correctly.
(B) Given, total question = 120
Questions that were answered correctly = 80
Thus, questions answered by guessing

11. Let the prices of one round of shooting and

bowling in the combo packs to be ` x and ` y
respectively.
According to the question, pair of linear
equations for the combo packs are
3x + 2y = 285
...(i)
4x + 5y = 485
...(ii)
On multiplying eq. (i) by 4 and eq. (ii) by 3, we get

–
–7y = –315
Þ
y = 45
Now, it is given that the price of one round of
bowling in the solo pack is ` 60.
Thus, the price of one round of bowling in the
solo pack = ` 60 – ` 45 = ` 15 more than that
of the combo pack.

12. Let the age of the father and the son be x years

and y years respectively.
x + y = 40
...(i)
According to the question,
x = 3y or x – 3y = 0
...(ii)
On subtracting eq. (ii) from eq. (i), we get
4y = 40
Þ
y = 10
On putting this value in eq. (i), we get
x + 10 = 40

x = 30
Hence, the ages of father and son be 30 years
and 10 years respectively.

And according to the VP’s clue,
y + 3 = 3x
Or
3x – y = 3
….(ii)
On subtracting eqn. (i) from (ii), we get
x =4
Put x = 4 in eqn. (i) we get , y = 9
Thus, the passcode of locker is 4994.

15. It is given that x, y and 40° are the angles of a

triangle.
We know that the sum of all angles of a
triangle is 180o.
x + y + 40° = 180°
x + y = 140°
...(i)
Also, it is given that the difference of the angles
x and y is 30°.
x – y = 30°
...(ii)
Adding eq. (i) and (ii), we get
(x + y) + (x – y) = 140° + 30°
2x = 170°
x = 85°
Putting the value of x in eq. (i), we get
85° + y = 140°
y = 140° – 85°
y = 55°
Hence, the required values of x and y are
85° and 55° respectively.

Equating (i) and (ii), we get
12x – 6 = 9x + 9
3x = 15
x=5
Put the value of x in equation (i), we get
12 × 5 – 6 = x × y

xy = 54
So, he have ` 54 and there were 5 persons.

17. Let A have x number of mangoes and B have y

number of mangoes.
According to the question,
x + 30 = 2 (y – 30)
x + 30 = 2y – 60
x – 2y = –90
...(i)
and
y + 10 = 3(x – 10)
y + 10 = 3x – 30
3x – y = 40
...(ii)
Multiplying equation (ii) by 2 and then
subtracting it from equation (i), we get
x – 2y = –90
6x – 2y = 80

–
– 5x = – 170
x = 34
Putting x = 34 in equation (i), we get

y = 62
So, A and B have 34 and 62 mangoes
respectively.

18. Let the digit in tens place be x and unit place
be y.
Sum of digits is, x + y = 9
...(i)
The two-digit number is of the form 10x + y
When 27 is added, the digits get reversed
\ The new number
= 10y + x
So,
10x + y + 27 = 10y + x
10x – x + y – 10y + 27 = 0
9x – 9y + 27 = 0
x–y+3 = 0
x–y = –3
...(ii)
On solving eqn. (i) and (ii), we get
x = 3, y = 6
So, the product of the digits = 3 × 6

Then, two-digit number = x + 10y
According to the first condition,
x+y =9

...(i)

When we reverse the order of the digits, reversed
two-digit number= y + 10x
So, according to the second condition,
9 × (x + 10y) = 2 × (y + 10x)
9x + 90y = 2y + 20x
88y = 11x
x = 8y
x – 8y = 0

...(ii)

On subtracting equation (ii) from equation (i),
we get
(x + y) – (x – 8y) = 9 – 0
9y = 9
y =1
On putting y = 1 in eqn. (i), we get
x =9–1=8
Hence, the number is 10 × 1 + 8 = 18.

x + 2y = 8

...(iii)

Let lines (i), (ii) and (iii) represent the sides of a
∆ABC i.e., AB, BC and CA respectively.
On solving lines (i) and (ii), we will get the
intersection point B.
So, multiplying eq. (i) by 3 and then subtracting
eq. (ii) from it, we get
(9x – 3y) – (2x – 3y) = 9 – 2
7x = 7
x=1
Putting the value of x in eq. (i), we get
3×1–y = 3

Hence, the coordinates of point/vertex B are
(1, 0).
On solving lines (ii) and (iii), we will get the

Hence, the coordinates of point/vertex C is (4, 2).
On solving lines (iii) and (i), we will get the

i.e.,
(x + 20) = 2(y – 20)
⇒
x – 2y = –60
...(ii)
On subtracting eq. (ii) from eq. (i), we get
(x – y) – (x –2y) = 20 – (–60)
⇒
y = 80
On putting the value of y in eq. (i), we get
x – 80 = 20

x = 100
Hence, 100 students are in hall A and
80 students are in hall B.

Then, according to the question,
t2 – t1 = 1
…(i)
Now, let the distance travelled by Kimaya be
x m and Heena be y m.
\ The total distance travelled by Kimaya
and Heena = x + y = 800 – 180 [given, total
distance = 800 m]
⇒
x + y = 620
…(ii)
By using the constant speeds of Kimaya and
Heena, x = 100t1 and y = 80t2
….(iii)
From, eq. (i) and (ii), we get
100t1 + 80t2 = 620
100(t2 – 1) + 80t2 = 620
[Using eq. (i)]
100t2 – 100 + 80t2 = 620
t2 = 4 minutes
Thus, the time taken by Heena is 4 minutes.

–7x = –2100
x = 300
Putting the value of x in eq. (i), we get
2(300) + 3y = 1200
3y = 1200 – 600
3y = 600
y = 200
Total number of bananas

Hence, the total number of bananas he had is
500.

Hence, the length of the journey is 720 km.

11. (A) We have,
Usual speed of plane = x km/hr
Since, speed of plane was increased by
250 km/hr,
So, increased speed of plane
= (x + 250) km/hr
Now, we know,
Distance
Time =
Speed

(C) According to the question, speed of the
plane is increased by 250 km/hr
\ x + 250 = 750 + 250

12. (A) Given, the time taken by the second pipe
alone to fill the swimming pool = x hours.

So, the time taken by first pipe = (x + 5)
hours and by third pipe = (x – 4) hours.

(B) The quadratic equation is
x2 + 250x – 750000 = 0 [From A]
x2 + 1000x – 750x – 750000 = 0
(x + 1000) (x – 750) = 0
x = 750, x = –1000 (speed can’t be negative)
So, speed of plane is 750 km/hr.

[from (B), x = 750]

So, the increased speed of the plane is

(B) We have to find the roots of the quadratic
equation x2 – 8x – 20 = 0.
x2 – 10x + 2x – 20 = 0
x(x – 10) + 2(x – 10) = 0
(x + 2) (x – 10) = 0
x = –2, 10
As time cannot be negative, time taken by
second pipe = x = 10 hours
And, time taken by first pipe = x + 5
= 15 hours.

x + x – 306 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0
which is the required quadratic equation.

28. Let the age of the boy be x years.
So, age of his father be (32 – x) years.
According to question,
1
x (32 – x) = x + 10
5
⇒
32x – x2 = 5x + 50
2
⇒
x – 27x + 50 = 0
2
⇒ x – 25x – 2x + 50 = 0
⇒ x (x – 25) – 2 (x – 25) = 0
⇒
(x – 2)(x – 25) = 0
⇒
x = 2, x = 25
If
x = 25,
Age of the boy = 25 years
Age of his father = 32 – 25

Hence, Age of the boy = 2 years
Age of his father = 32 – 2

132 = (x – 7)2 + x2
169 = x2+ 49 – 14x + x2
2
2x – 14x + 49 – 169 = 0
2x2 – 14x – 120 = 0
or
x2 – 7x – 60 = 0
x2 – 12x + 5x – 60 = 0
x(x – 12) + 5(x – 12) = 0
(x – 12) (x + 5) = 0
x – 12 = 0 or x + 5 = 0
x = 12 or x = – 5

But, length cannot be negative.
x = 12
Hence, base of triangle = 12 cm

31. Let the age of one friend be ‘x’.
Then, the age of another friend is 20 – x.
Four years ago,
The age of one friend = x – 4
The age of another friend = 20 – x – 4 = 16 – x
According to the question,
(x – 4) (16 – x) = 48
16x – 64 – x2 + 4x = 48
x2 – 20x + 112 = 0
On comparing this with ax2 + bx + c = 0, we get

Now, discriminant, D = b2 – 4ac
= (–20)2 – 4 × 1 × 112

which implies that the real roots are not
possible, since it has imaginary roots.
So, the solution of the given equation does not
exist and hence given situation is not possible.

35. Let Nisha’s present age be x years.
Then, Asha’s present age = (2 + x2)
[By the given condition]
Now, when Nisha grows to her mother’s
present age i.e. after {(x2 + 2) – x} years,
Then, Asha’s age will become
[{(x2 + 2) – x} + (2 + x2)] years.
Now by the given condition,
Asha’s age = 1 year less than 10 times the
present age of Nisha.
(2 + x2) + {(x2 + 2) – x} = 10x – 1
2 + x2 + x2 + 2 – x = 10x – 1
2x2 – 11x + 5 = 0
Splitting the middle term, we have
2x2 – 10x – x + 5 = 0
2x(x – 5) – 1(x – 5) = 0
(x – 5)(2x – 1) = 0

9. (A) All the flags are kept at the position of the
middle most flag or the 14th flag. There are
13 flags on either side of the middle most
flag at a distance of 3 m from each other.
The first flag is at a distance of 3 m, the
second at a distance of 6 m, the third at
a distance of 9 m and so on, and this is on
both sides of the middle most flag.

As Arzoo has to come back to the position
of the middle most flag each time, the
distance travelled for placing the first
flag and coming back is 3 + 3 or 6 m, the
distance travelled for placing the second
flag and back is 6 + 6 or 12 m and so on.
The distances covered by Arzoo in placing
flags on one side of the middle most flag
are 6 m, 12 m, 18 m, …
This forms an A.P. with a = 6 m and
d = 6 m.
(B) The distance covered by Arzoo in placing
all the flags on both sides of the middle
most flag is found by using the formula for
finding sum of first n terms of an A.P. i.e.,
n
S n = [2a + ( n − 1)d ]
2
The total distance covered by Arzoo in
placing all the flags on both sides of the
middle most flag = 2 × (Distance covered
by Arzoo in placing 13 flags on one side)
Taking n = 13, a = 6, d = 6, we get
Total distance = 2 × Sn

13


{2 × 6 + (13 − 1) 6}
2


=2× 

= 13 × [12 + 12 × 6] = 13 × 84
= 1092 m

(C) The maximum distance Arzoo travelled
carrying a flag = distance travelled by
Arzoo during placing the 14th flag in her left
position or 27th flag in her right position.
= (3 + 3 + 3 + . . . . . + 13 times)
= 3 × 13 = 39 m
Hence, the maximum distance she travelled
carrying a flag is 39 m.

10. (A) The first two consecutive average monthly

velocity term is 27360 and 30915.
Common difference = 30915 – 27360
= 3555
The next two consecutive average monthly
velocity term is 30915 and 34470.
Common difference = 34470 – 30915
= 3555
It concludes that the common difference is
same and thus average monthly velocity
forms an arithmetic progression.
(B) Given, the distance travelled by the
spacecraft in the first 10 months
(or 7300 hours) can be expressed as 7300 p.
To find p i.e., sum of average monthly
velocity for the first 10 months i.e.,
Sn =

n
[2a + (n – 1)d]
2

⇒ p = S10 =

10
[(2 × 27360) + (10 – 1) × 3555]
2

= 5 [54720 + 31995]
= 433575
Thus, the value of p is 433575 km/hour.
(C) Let the spacecraft passed borelly after
N months. Then number of months,
N = n + 15.

The average monthly velocity when it
passed Borelly is given by,
⇒
aN = a + (N – 1) d
= a +(n + 15 – 1) d
= a + (n – 1)d + 15d
⇒
aN = an + 15d
[Q an = a + (n –1) d]
It is given that the velocity when it passed
Braille, an = 55800 km/hr.
⇒
aN = 55800 + 15 × 3555
= 109125 km/hr.

11. Given, a6 = 16000, a9 = 22600

\
a + 5d = 16000
...(i)
and
a + 8d = 22600
...(ii)
On substituting a = 1600 – 5d, we get [from (i)]
Þ 16000 – 5d + 8d = 22600
Þ
3d = 22600 – 16000
Þ
3d = 6600

= 11600
a7 = a + 6d
= 5000 + 6 × 2200
= 5000 + 13200
= 18200
a7 – a4 = 18200 – 11600
= 6600
Thus, the difference of production during
7th year and 4th year is 6600 sets.

12. The given A.P. is 2m +

The nth term of an A.P. is given by,
an = a + (n – 1)d

a = 16000 – 5(2200)

The given list of numbers of the A.P. is:

We know that, an = a + (n – 1)d

a30 = a + (30 – 1)d = a + 29d

a20 = a + (20 – 1)d = a + 19d

We know that,
an = a + (n – 1) d

[an = a + (n – 1)d]
[a1 + 99d] – [a2 + 99d] = 100
a1 – a2 =100
...(i)
Now, to find the difference between their
1000th terms
[a1 + (1000 – 1)d] – [a2 + (1000 – 1)d]
= a1 + 999d – a2 – 999d
= a1 – a2
By equation (i), we get
[a1 + (1000 – 1)d] – [a2 + (1000 – 1)d]
= a1 – a2 = 100
Therefore, difference between their 1000th
terms would be equal to 100.

Concept Applied
 For finding whether a given sequence is an A.P. or

not, students need to find the difference between
all the given consecutive terms.

31. The first three-digit number divisible by 7 is

105 and last three-digit number divisible by 7
is 994.
Thus, we have to determine number of terms
in 105, 112, 119 ....... 994.
This series forms an A.P. as difference between
any two consecutive terms is same i.e. 7.
So, a = 105, d = 7 and an = 994.
Let the number of terms in A.P. be ‘n’.
We know,

an = a + (n – 1)d
994 = 105 + (n – 1)7

30. Given, A.P. is 3, 3 + 2 , 3 + 2 2 , 3 + 3 2 ............
Here,

2

994 = 105 + 7n – 7

2

7n = 994 – 105 + 7
7n = 1001 – 105 = 896

a3 – a2 = 3 + 2 2 – 3 +

⇒

4

Hence, there are 128 three-digit numbers,
which are divisible by 7.

) ( 2) = 2
a – a = (3 + 3 2 ) – (3 + 2 2 ) = 2 and so
on
(

3

Since, the difference of any two consecutive
terms is same i.e.,

2 . Then, it forms an A.P.

with common difference (d) =
Now, next three terms
a5 = a4 +

2 =3+ 4 2

2

=3+ 4 2 +

32. Let d be the common difference of two A.P.’s.
First term of first A.P. is 2.
So, first A.P. will be 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d ...
Also, first term of second A.P. is 7

2

=3+ 3 2 +
a6 = a5 +

2.

n = 128

So, second A.P. will be 7, 7 + d, 7 + 2d ...
We know that,

an = a + (n – 1)d

10 term of first A.P. = 2 + 9d
th

2 =3+5 2

and 10th term of second A.P. = 7 + 9d

Arithmetic Progressions

95

Difference of their 10th terms
= (7 + 9d) – (2 + 9d)
= 7 + 9d – 2 – 9d

Clearly, a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = a4 – a3
Hence, 2n – 3 is the nth term of an A.P.
(B) No, (3n2 + 5) is not the nth term of an A.P.
It is given that an = 3n2 + 5

=5

Put

Similarly, 21st term of first A.P. = 2 + 20d

Put n = 2, a2 = 3(2)2 + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17

and 21st term of second A.P. = 7 + 20d

Put n = 3, a3 = 3(3)2 + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32

Difference of their 21st terms

List of numbers becomes 8, 17, 32 ...

= (7 + 20d) – (2 + 20d)
= 7 + 20d – 2 – 20d = 5
Thus, we can say that if an and bn are nth terms
of first and second A.P. respectively, then
= 7 + (n – 1)d – 2 – (n – 1)d = 5
bn – an = 5

a2 – a1 = 17 – 8 = 9,

and,

a3 – a2 = 32 – 17 = 15

Hence, (3n2 + 5) is not the nth term of an
A.P.
(C) No, (1 + n + n2) is not the nth term of an A.P.
It is given that an = 1 + n + n2

Hence, the difference between any two
corresponding terms of such A.P.’s is the same
as the difference between two corresponding
first terms.

Put n = 1,

a1 = 1 + (1) + (1)2

Put n = 2,

a2 = 1 + (2) + (2)2

=1+1+1=3
=1+2+4=7

33. As given in the question, there are three

a3 = 1 + (3) + (3)2

sections of each class, so number of trees
planted by class I, II, III...... XII are respectively, 1
× 3, 2 × 3, 3 × 3 ..... and 12 × 3.

Put n = 3,

Thus, the sequence is 3, 6, 9 ...... 36.

Here,

a2 – a1 = 7 – 3 = 4

and,

a3 – a2 = 13 – 7 = 6

= 1 + 3 + 9 = 13
List of numbers becomes 3, 7, 13 ...

This forms an A.P. with first term, a = 3
common difference, d = 6 – 3 = 3

Clearly, a2 – a1 ≠ a3 – a2

Now, the number of trees planted by students
= Sum of 12 terms of A.P. formed

Hence, the total trees planted are 234.

first part = a – d = 69 – 2 = 67,
second part = a = 69

26. No, the given statement is not correct.
We know that by SAS similarity criterion, if one
angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the
other triangle and the sides including these
angles are proportional, then the two triangles
are similar.
Here, an angle of one triangle is equal to an
angle of another triangle and two sides are
proportional, even then the triangles are not
similar because these proportional sides may
or may not include the equal angles.

8. Raycasting is a technique used in the
creation of computer games. The basic idea
of raycasting is as follows: the map is a 2D
square grid. Using rays generated from an
object, this 2D map can be transformed into
a 3D perspective. One of the methods involves
sending out a ray from the player's location.
To determine how far he/she is from a wall or
an obstacle, the distance between the player's
coordinates and the coordinate of the wall is
calculated. If the player is near the obstacle, it
looks larger and vice-versa.

x(x – 9) – 5(x – 9) = 0

Hence, there are two points that lie on x-axis,

42. (A) Since PQRS is a square and P and Q are on
the x-axis with coordinates (–200, 0) and
(200, 0) respectively. R and S must be at
an equal distance from the x-axis. The side
length of the square is PQ = [200 – (–200)]
= 400 units.
Therefore, the y-coordinates of R and S
must be 400 units away from the x-axis.
Since, R is vertically above Q and S is
vertically above P, their coordinates are
R (200, 400) and S (–200, 400).
(B) The area of square PQRS

8. (A) As PA and PB are tangents to the circle
at the points A and B, respectively, so
AP ^ OA and BP ^ OB, as tangent to a
circle is perpendicular to the radius through
the point of contact.
So, ∠OAP= 90° and ∠OBP = 90°.
Since, PAOB is a quadrilateral
and ∠OAP + ∠OBP = 180°,
∠AOB + ∠APB = 180°,
[by angle sum property of quadrilateral]
This means that ∠APB = 180° – ∠AOB
= 180° – 110°
= 70°.
(B) We have, OB = Radius = 5 cm,
OP = 13 cm.

 The sum of the four angles of a
quadrilateral is 360º.
∴ ∠OXM + ∠XMY + ∠OYM + ∠XOY = 360º
⇒ 90º + ∠XMY + 90º + ∠XOY = 360º
[From eqn (i) and (ii)]

∠XMY + ∠XOY = 360º – 180º

(C) Triangle ODC is also a right-angled triangle
as OD ^ CD.
[Q CD is a tangent and OD is a radius and
we know that tangent is perpendicular to
radius at the point of contact.]
Therefore, applying Pythagoras theorem, we
get,

[Sides of square are equal]
Now, CR and CQ are the tangents from an

17. Given:
∠ABO = 40° and XAY is a tangent to circle,
AO and BO are radius hence AO = OB

Now, In DAOB,
∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180° [sum of all
three angles of a triangle is 180°]
40° + 40° + ∠AOB = 180°
∠AOB = 180° – 80°
Hence,
∠AOB = 100°

Then,
∠OAY = 90°
∠BAY = ∠OAY – ∠OAB
∠BAY = 90° – 40°
∠BAY = 50°

18. We have, ∠AOQ = 58°
We know that, the angle subtended by an arc
at any point on the circumference of a circle is
half of the angle subtended by the same arc at
the centre.
Since, ∠ABQ and ∠AOQ are the angles formed

Here, OA is perpendicular to TA because OA is

Also,
∠ABT = ∠ABQ = 29°
So, in DBAT ,
∠ATB = 180° – (∠BAT + ∠ABT)

Thus,
∠ATQ = ∠ATB = 61°.

touch at B and C and another tangent at point
A meets the previous tangent at P.

Similarly,
BP = BQ = 8 cm
and
QC = RC = x (say)
AC = 6 + x

Important
 The result obtained by all the three methods is
the same. So the choice of method to be used
depends on the numerical values of xi and fi. If
xi and fi are sufficiently small, then the direct
method is an appropriate choice. If xi and fi are
numerically large numbers, then we can go for the
assumed mean method or step-deviation method.
If the class sizes are unequal, and xi are large
numerically, we can still apply the step-deviation
method by taking h to be a suitable divisor of all
the di ’s.

∴

Sum of eight numbers = 23 × 8

Let the newly added number be x.
Now, there are nine numbers in the set of data.
So,
Sum of nine numbers = 184 + x
184 + x
∴
Mean of nine numbers =
9
But,
mean of nine numbers = 22
[Given]
184 + x = 22
∴

29. No.
The area of region 3 is double than that of
regions 1 or 2, therefore its probability is
double than the probabilities of 1 or 2.
Hence, probability of 1 = probability of 2 ≠
probability of 3.
Thus, the outcomes of 1, 2 and 3 are not
equally likely to occur.

One evening, Kaushik was in a park. Children were playing cricket. Birds were singing on a
nearby tree of height 80m.

He observed a bird on the tree at an angle of elevation of 45°.

When a sixer was hit, a ball flew through the tree frightening the bird to fly away.

In 2

seconds, he observed the bird flying at the same height at an angle of elevation of 30° and
the ball flying towards him at the same height at an angle of elevation of 60°.

SECTION-E
36. Conical Tank: The advantages of cylindrical tank having conical bottom are found in nearly

every industry, especially

where getting every last drop from the tank is important. This type of

tank has excellent geometry for draining, especially with high solids content slurries as these
cone tanks provide a better full-drain solution. The conical tank eliminates many of the problems
that flat base tanks have as the base of the tank is sloped towards the centre giving the greatest
possible full- drain system in vertical tank design.

Rajesh has been given the task of designing a conical bottom tank for his client. Height of
conical part is equal to its radius. Length of cylindrical part is the 3 times of its radius. Tank is

REAL NUMBERS
1. Important Concepts/ Result
Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic): Every composite number can be expressed
(factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime
factors occur.
HCF: Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers.
LCM: Product of the greatest power of each prime factor, involved in the numbers.
Theorem 1.2: Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, whereas is a positive integer.
Proof: Let the prime factorisation of 𝑎 be as follows:
𝑎 = 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , . . . , 𝑝𝑛 , where 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , . . . , 𝑝𝑛 are primes, not necessarily distinct. Therefore,
𝑎2 = ( 𝑝1𝑝2 . . . 𝑝𝑛)( 𝑝1𝑝2 . . . 𝑝𝑛) = 𝑝2 1𝑝2 2 . . . 𝑝2 𝑛. now, we are given that p divides a2.
Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2.
However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only
prime factors of a2 are 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , . . . , 𝑝𝑛 . So p is one of 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , . . . , 𝑝𝑛 .
Now, since 𝑎 = 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , . . . , 𝑝𝑛 , and 𝑝 divides a.
We are now ready to give a proof that 2 is irrational. The proof is based on a technique called „proof by
contradiction‟.
Theorem 1.3: 2 is irrational.
Proof: Let us assume, to the contrary, that 2 is rational.
r

So, we can find integers r and s (≠ 0) such that 2 = s . Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1.
a

Then, we divide by the common factor to get 2 ,  where a and b are co-prime.
b

So, b 2 = a.
Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b2 = a2 . Therefore, 2 divides a2.
Now, by Theorem 1.3, it follows that 2 divides a.
So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 2b2 = 4c2 , that is, b2 = 2c2.
This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.3 with p = 2). Therefore, a and b
have at least 2 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1. This contradiction has arisen
because of our incorrect assumption that 2is rational. So, we conclude that 2 is irrational.
2. Some Illustrations/ Examples
i) MCQs

ii) Short answer type questions
1. Show that 6- 2 is irrational
𝑎

Solution: Let 6- 2 is rational. Then, 6- 2 = 𝑏 (where a, b are co-prime integers and b ≠ 0)
𝑎

6𝑏−𝑎

6 - 𝑏 = 2=>

𝑏

= 2
𝑎

Since a and b are integers, we get 6 - 𝑏 is rational and so 2 is rational.
But this contradicts the fact that 2is irrational. Hence out assumption 6- 2 is rational is wrong. So 6- 2is
irrational.
2. Find the HCF and LCM of 12, 14 and 16 using prime factorisation method.
Solution: 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 = 22 x 31, 14 = 2 x 7 = 21 x 71, 16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 24
H.C.F (12, 14, 16) = 21 = 2, LCM (12, 14, 16) = 24 x 31 x 71 = 16 x 21= 336
3. If the HCF of 65 and 117 is expressible in the form 65m – 117, then the value of m is
Solution: 117 > 65, 117 = 65 × 1 + 52,
65 = 52 × 1 + 13,
52 = 13 × 4 + 0,
HCF(65,117) = 13
According to the given, 65𝑚 – 117 = 13, 65m = 117 + 13,

POLYNOMIALS
Important Concepts/ Result:
1. Polynomial: If x is a variable, n is a natural number and a0, a1, a2, a3, ……….
an are real numbers, then p(x) = anxn + an–1xn-1 + ......... + a1 x + a0, (an ≠0) is
called a polynomial in x.
2. Polynomials of degree 1, 2 and 3 are called linear, quadratic and cubic polynomialsrespectively.
3. Polynomial in the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers and a  0 is called a quadratic
polynomial in variable x.
4. A polynomial can have at most the same number of zeros as the degree of the
polynomial
5. A real number k is said to be a zero of a polynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.
6. The graph of the corresponding equation y = ax2 + bx + c has one of the two shapes either open upwards
like or open downwards like depending on whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These curves are called parabolas.)

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
KEY POINTS:
The general form for a pair of linear equations in two variables x and y .
a1x + b1y + c1 = 0
a2x + b2y + c2 = 0
Where a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 are all real numbers and a1≠ 0, b1 ≠0, a2≠ 0, b2≠ 0.
Consistency of system of linear equations in two variables
A pair of values of the variables x and y satisfying each one of the equation is called a solution of the
system.
Consistent System: A system of linear equations is said to consistent if it has at least one solution.
In-consistent System: A system of linear equation is said to be in-consistent if it has no solution.
Algebraic methods of solving a pair of linear equations:

SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ques1. Determine, whether the system of equations is consistent or in-consistent.
x + y = 14 and x – y = 4
Solution: Rearrange the given equation like general form: x + y -14 = 0 and x – y – 4 = 0
By comparing we get, a1  1 , b1 = 1, c1  14 , a 2  1 , b2 = - 1, c2  4
a1

Therefore, system of equations has only one sol
a 2 b2

Hence, the system of equations is consistent
Ques-2 Solve the following system of equation by substitution method: x + y = 14 and x – y = 4
SOLUTION: Equations are x + y = 14 ……… (i) x – y = 4 ………(ii)
from equation (ii) find x in term of y x = y + 4 ……… (iii)
substitute this x in (i), we get (y + 4) + y = 14,
or 2y + 4 = 14,
or 2y = 14 – 4
or 2y = 10 or y = 10/2 ,
or y = 5
Now from equation (iii) we find the value of x with the help of (y = 5) x = 5 + 4 = 9
Thus, x = 9 and y = 5
Ques3 Solve the following system of equation by elimination method: 2x + y = 24 and x –2y = 7
10

Solution: Given equations are
2x + y = 24 ……… (i),
x –2y = 7 ………(ii)
Here, if we multiply by 2 in equation (i) and adding with equation (ii), we get
4x + 2y = 48 ……… (i)
,x - 2y = 7 ……(ii),
5x = 55,
Or x = 55/5, Or x = 11
Now, in equation (i) putting the value of x to find y
2 x 11 + y = 24 Or 22 + y = 24 Or y = 24 – 22 Or y = 2 ,
Thus, x = 11 and y = 2
Ques 4 To determine the value of k (unknown) for which the given system of linear equations has infinitely
many solutions. 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + ky = 10
Solution: Rearrange the given equation in general form 2x + 3y - 5 = 0 and 4x + ky – 10 = 0
By comparing we get,

a1 2 b1 3 c1  5
 ,

a 2 4 b2 k c2  10

For infinitely many solutions, we must have

a1 b1 c1 2 3  5
 
 
a2 b2 c2 , 4 k  10

Or k = 2 x 3 ,

Or k = 6

Hence, the given system of equations will have infinitely many solutions, if k = 6

QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
I. Important Concepts / Results
A quadratic polynomial of the form ax² + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are real numbers, is called a
quadratic equation
when ax² + bx + c = 0.
Here a and b are the coefficients of x² and x respectively and „c‟ is a constant term.
Any value is a solution of a quadratic equation if and only if it satisfies the quadratic equation.
Quadratic formula: The roots, i.e., α and β of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 are given
−𝑏± 𝑏 2 −4𝑎𝑐

−𝑏± 𝐷

by 𝑥 =
where b² – 4ac ≥ 0 or 𝑥 = 2𝑎
2𝑎
Here, the value b² – 4ac=D is known as the discriminant and is generally denoted by D. „D‟ helps us to
determine the nature of roots for a given quadratic equation. Thus D = b² – 4ac.
The rules are: If D = 0 ⇒ The roots are Real and Equal. If D > 0 ⇒ The two roots are Real and Unequal.
If D < 0 ⇒ No Real roots exist.
If α and β are the roots of the quadratic equation, then Quadratic equation is:
x² – (α + β) x + αβ = 0 Or x² – (sum of roots) x + product of roots = 0
Examples
i) MCQ
1) 1. Which of the following is not a quadratic equation
(a) x² + 3x – 5 = 0
(b) x² + x3 + 2 = 0
(c) 3 + x + x² = 0
(d) x² – 9 = 0
Ans:- (b)
:Reason: Since it has degree 3.
2) The polynomial equation x (x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2) is
(a) linear equation
(b) quadratic equation
(c) cubic equation
(d) bi-quadratic equation
Ans:- (a)
Explaination: We have x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
⇒ x² + x + 8 = x² – 4
⇒ x² + x + 8- x² + 4 = 0
⇒ x + 12 = 0, which is a linear equation.
3) The roots of the quadratic equation 6x² – x – 2 = 0 are

Ans:- ( c)
Explaination:Reason: We have 6×2 – x – 2 = 0
⇒ 6x² + 3x-4x-2 = 0
⇒ 3x(2x + 1) -2(2x + 1) = 0
⇒ (2x + 1) (3x – 2) = 0
⇒ 2x + 1 = 0 or 3x – 2 = 0
1

2

∴ x =− 22, x = 3
4) If one root of the quadratic equation 2x² + kx – 6 = 0 is 2, the value of k is
(a) 1
(b) -1
(c) 2
(d) -2
Ans: (b)
Reason: Scice x = 2 is a root of the equation 2x² + kx -6 = 0
∴ 2(2)² +k(2) – 6 = 0
⇒ 8 + 2k – 6 = 0
19

⇒ 2k = -2
∴ k = -1
5) The roots of the equation 7x² + x – 1 = 0 are
(a) real and distinct
(b) real and equal
(c) not real
(d) none of these
Answer: (a)
Reason: Here a = 2, b = 1, c = -1
∴ D = b² – 4ac = (1)² – 4 × 2 × (-1) = 1 + 8 = 9 > 0
∴ Roots of the given equation are real and distinct.
Short Answer type Questions:1) If the equation 12x² + 4kx + 3 = 0 has real and equal roots, find the value of k
Solution: Here a = 12, b = 4k, c = 3
Since the given equation has real and equal roots
∴ b² – 4ac = 0
⇒ (4k)² – 4 × 12 × 3 = 0
⇒ 16k² – 144 = 0
⇒ k² = 9
⇒ k = ±3
2) Find the roots of the quadratic equation 2x2 + x – 6 = 0
Solution: x2 – 5x + 2x – 10=0
=>x(x – 5) + 2(x – 5)=0
=>(x – 5)(x + 2)=0
Therefore, x – 5 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
=> x = 5 or x = -2
3) Find two consecutive positive integers, the sum of whose squares is 365.
Solution:
Let us say the two consecutive positive integers are x and x + 1.
Therefore, as per the given questions,
x2 + (x + 1)2 = 365
⇒ x2 + x2 + 1 + 2x = 365
⇒ 2x2 + 2x – 364 = 0
⇒ x2 + x – 182 = 0
⇒ x2 + 14x – 13x – 182 = 0
⇒ x(x + 14) -13(x + 14) = 0
⇒ (x + 14)(x – 13) = 0
Thus, either, x + 14 = 0 or x – 13 = 0,
⇒ x = – 14 or x = 13
Since the integers are positive, x can be 13 only.
∴ x + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14
Therefore, two consecutive positive integers will be 13 and 14.

ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS
KEY POINTS
1. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a
fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term. The fixed number d is called the common
difference.
The general form of an AP is a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ……..
2. A given list of numbers a1 , a2 , a3, a4, a5, . . . is an AP, if the differences a2 – a1 , a3 – a2 , a4 – a3 ,
. . ., give the same value, i.e., ak + 1 – ak is the same for different values of k.
3. In an AP with first term a and common difference d, the nth term (or the general term) is given by
an = a + (n – 1) d.
𝑛
4. The sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by :𝑆𝑛 = 2 2𝑎 + 𝑛 − 1 𝑑
5. If l is the last term of the finite AP, say the nth term, then the sum of all terms of the AP is given
𝑛
by : 𝑆𝑛 = 2 𝑎 + 𝑙)
6. If a, b, c are in AP, then b =

𝑎+𝑐
2

and b is called the arithmetic mean of a and c

MCQS
1. The sum of the first five multiples of 3 is:
(a) 45(b) 55(c) 65(d) 75
Answer: (a) 45
Explanation: The first five multiples of 3 is 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15
a=3 and d=3n=5
Sum, Sn = n/2[2a+(n-1)d]
S5 = 5/2[2(3)+(5-1)3]=5/2[6+12]=5/2[18]=5 x 9= 45
2. The 10th term of the AP: 5, 8, 11, 14, … is
(a) 32 (b) 35 (c) 38 (d) 185
Answer: (a) 32
Explanation:
Given AP: 5, 8, 11, 14,….
First term = a = 5
Common difference = d = 8 – 5 = 3
nth term of an AP = an = a + (n – 1)d
Now, 10th term = a10 = a + (10 – 1)d
= 5 + 9(3)= 5 + 27= 32
3. In an AP, if d = -4, n = 7, an = 4, then a is
(a) 6 (b) 7 (c) 20 (d) 28
Answer: (d) 28
Solution;Given,d = -4, n = 7, an = 4
We know that,an = a + (n – 1)d
4 = a + (7 – 1)(-4)
4 = a + 6(-4)
4 = a – 24
⇒ a = 4 + 24 = 28
24

4. 30th term of the A.P: 10, 7, 4, …, is
(a) 97
(b) 77
(c) -77

(d) -87

Answer: (c) -77
Explanation: Given,A.P. = 10, 7, 4, …
First term, a = 10, Common difference, d = a2 − a1 = 7−10 = −3
As we know, for an A.P., an = a +(n−1)d
Putting the values;
a30 = 10+(30−1)(−3)
a30 = 10+(29)(−3)
a30 = 10−87 = −77
5. The missing terms in AP: __, 13, __, 3 are:
(a) 11 and 9
(b) 17 and 9
(c) 18 and 8
Answer: (c)
Explanation: a2 = 13 and a4 = 3
The nth term of an AP;

(d) 18 and 9

an = a+(n−1) d
a2 = a +(2-1)d
13 = a+d ………………. (i)
a4 = a+(4-1)d
3 = a+3d ………….. (ii)
Subtracting equation (i) from (ii), we get,
– 10 = 2d
d=–5
13 = a+(-5)
a3 = 18+(3-1)(-5)= 18+2(-5) = 18-10 = 8 (third term).

(iii) In which year, the production is `₹ 29,200.
OR
(iii) Find the difference of the production during 7th year and 4th year.
Sol. `(i) 5000
Explanation: a6 = 16,000
a + (n + 1)d = 16,000
a + (6 – 1)d = 16,000
a + 5d = 16,000 ...(i)
a9 = 22,600
a + (n – 1)d = 22,600
a + (9 – 1)d = 22,600
a + 8d = 22,600 ...(ii)
25

Solving equation (i) and (ii) a + 5d = 16,000
a + 8d = 22,600 – – – –
3d = – 6,600
d = 2,200
Now, putting d = 2,200 in equation (i)
a + 5d = 16,000
a + 5 × 2,200 = 16,000
a + 11,000 = 16,000
a = 5,000
OR
(i) Sol. Production during 8th year is (a + 7d) = 5000 + 2(2200) = 20400
(II) Sol. Production during first 3 year = 5000 + 7200 + 9400 = 21600
(III)Sol. N = 12
Explanation: an = 29,200
a + (n – 1)d = 29,200
(x – 1)2,900 = 29,200 – 5,000
2,200n – 2,200 = 24,200
2200n = 26,400 n = 26 400/ 2 200 ,n = 12
(IV) Sol. Difference = 18200 – 11600 = 6600
SHORT ANSWER TYPE
Q.1: Which term of the AP: 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give reason for your answer.
Solution, a = 21d = 18 - 21 = -3 .
Let -81 be the nth term.
Now,nth term, -81 = 21 + ( n -1 ) -3
-81 = 21 -3n + 3
-81 = 24-3n
3n = 24 + 81
n=35Therefore, the 35th term is -81 and the eighth term is 0.
Q.2: The fourth term of an AP is zero. Prove that its 25th term is triple its 11th term.
Ans: Given that a4=0
⇒a+3d=0
⇒a=−3d
…(1)
We have to prove that a25=3a11
⇒a+24d=3(a+10d)
⇒a+24d=3a+30d
From equation (1),
⇒−3d+24d=3(−3d)+30d
⇒21d=21d
∴LHS=RHS
Hence proved.

Solution:. Let the four consecutive terms of A.P. be (a – 3d), (a – d), (a + d) and (a + 3d).
By given conditions a – 3d + a – d + d + a + 3d = 32 ⇒ 4a = 32
𝑎−3𝑑 𝑎+3𝑑

CASE STUDY 2- SCALE FACTOR
A scale drawing of an object is the same shape at the object but a different size.
The scale of a drawing is a comparison of the length used on a drawing to the
length it represents. The scale is written as a ratio. The ratio of two corresponding
sides in similar figures is called the scale factor
Scale factor= length in image / corresponding length in object
If one shape can become another using revising, then the shapes are similar.
Hence, two shapes are similar when one can become the other after a resize, flip,
slide or turn. In the photograph below showing the side view of a train engine.
Scale factor is 1:200.
This means that a length of 1 cm on the photograph above corresponds to a length of 200cm or
2 m, of the actual engine. The scale can also be written as the ratio of two lengths.

COORDINATE GEOMETRY
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS
A pair of numbers locate points on a plane called the coordinates. The distance of a point from the y-axis is
known as abscissa or x-coordinate. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called ordinate or ycoordinate.
Example: Consider a point P(3, 2), where 3 is the abscissa, and 2 is the
ordinate. 3 represent the distance of point P from the y-axis, and 2
represents the distance of point P from the x-axis.
Distance Formula
Distance between any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by

d  ( x2  x1 ) 2  ( y 2  y1 ) 2
Where d i2s the distance between the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
Section Formula
If the point P(x, y) divides the line segment joining A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) internally in the ratio m:n, then,
the coordinates of P are given by the section formula as:
mx  nx1 my 2  ny1
,
P(x,y) = ( 2
)
mn
mn
●Midpoint formula:
The coordinates of the point P(x, y) which is the midpoint of the line segment joining the points A(𝑥1 , 𝑦1),
and B(𝑥2 ,𝑦2) are:
P(x , y) =

CIRCLES
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS / RESULTS:
A tangent to a circle is a line that intersects/touches the circle at only one point.
There is only one tangent at a point on a circle
There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle.
The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius
through the point of contact.
The length of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is equal.

SOME ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXAMPLES:

6. In Figure given, PQL and PRM are tangents to the circle withcentre O at the points Q and R,
respectively and S is a point on the circle such that∠SQL = 50° and ∠SRM = 60°. Find ∠QSR?
Solution:
Here ∠OSQ = ∠OQS = 90°–50° = 40° and
∠RSO = ∠SRO = 90° – 60° = 30°.
Therefore, ∠QSR = 40° + 30° = 70°
7. BOA is a diameter of a circle and the tangent at a point P meets
BA extended at T. If ∠PBO = 30°, then find ∠PTA ?
Solution:
∠BPA = 90°,
∠PAB = ∠OPA = 60°.
Also, OP⊥PT.
Therefore, ∠APT = 30° and ∠PTA = 60° – 30° =30°.
8. In the figure quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle.
Prove that AD + BC = AB + CD
Solution:
As we know that, length of tangents drawn
from the external point are equal.
Therefore,
AP

=

AS.....(1)

BP

=

BQ.....(2)

CR

=

CQ.....(3)

DR

=

DS.....(4)

Adding equation (1),(2),(3) and (4), we get
AP+BP+CR+DR=AS+BQ+CQ+DS
(AP+BP)+(CR+DR)=(AS+DS)+(BQ+CQ)
⇒AB+CD=AD+BC
9. The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to

A point P lying outside the circle and two
tangents PQ, PR on the circle from P
52

a circle

To Prove :
PQ = PR.
Join OP, OQ and OR.
Then ∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles,
OQ = OR (Radii of the same circle)
OP = OP (Common)
Therefore, ∆ OQP ≅ ∆ ORP (RHS)
This gives PQ = PR (CPCT)
10. In Figure givern, from an external point P, a tangent PT and a line segment PAB is drawn to a circle
with centre O. ON is perpendicular on the chord AB.
Prove that : (i) PA . PB = PN2 – AN2
(ii) PN2 – AN2 = OP2 – OT2
(iii) PA.PB = PT
Solution:
(i)
PA . PB
= (PN – AN) (PN + BN)
= (PN – AN) (PN + AN)
(As AN = BN)
= PN2 – AN2
(ii)
PN2 – AN2 = (OP2 – ON2 ) – AN2 (As ON⊥PN)
= OP2 – (ON2 + AN2 )
= OP2 – OA2 (As ON⊥AN)
= OP2 – OT2 (As OA = OT)
(iii)
From (i) and (ii)
PA.PB = OP2 – OT2
= PT2 (As ∠OTP = 90°)

SURFACE AREA AND VOLUME
In our earlier classes, we have already learnt about plane figures and some solid figures also.
Plane Figures: A plane figure has only two dimensions namely, length and breadth.
For example:
Triangles, rectangles, circles, etc
Solid Figures: A solid figure has three dimensions namely, length, breadth and height (thickness)
For examples:
Cuboids, cubes, cylinders, spheres, cones, etc.
(i) Examples of cuboids are a book, a tile, a room, etc
(ii) a cube is a cuboid whose length, breadth and height are equal.
Examples of cubes are dice, ice-cream, etc
(iii) Examples of cylinders are jars, circular pipes, circular pencils, road rollers, etc.
(iv)Examples of cones are conical tents, ice-cream cones (when it has not been filled), funnel, etc
(v) Examples of spheres are cricket balls, fully blown footballs etc.
Some useful formulae
Cuboid: Let l be the length, b be the breadth and h be the height of a cuboid
Total surface area (TSA) of the cuboid = 2(𝑙𝑏 + 𝑏𝑕 + 𝑕𝑙) unit2
Area of four walls = 2(𝑙 + 𝑏)𝑕 unit2
Volume of cuboid = 𝑙 × 𝑏 × 𝑕 unit3
Cube: Let a be the length of each edge (side) of a cube.
Total surface area (TSA) of the cube = 6a2 unit2
Area of four walls = 4a2 unit2
Volume of cube = a3 unit3
Right circular cylinder: Let r be the radius of the circular base and h be the height of a right circular
cylinder, Then
Curved surface area = 2 π r h
Total surface area of closed right circular cylinder = 2 𝜋𝑟 𝑕 + 𝑟
Total surface area of right circular cylinder open at the top = (2𝜋𝑟𝑕 + π 𝑟 2 )
Volume = π r2h
Right circular cone: Let r be the radius of the circular base, h be the height and l be the slant height of a
right circular cone.l2 = h2 + r2
Circumference of the base = 2𝜋 𝑟
Area of the circular base = π r2
Curved surface area (CSA) = 𝜋 𝑟 𝑙
Total surface area = 𝜋𝑟 (𝑙 + 𝑟)

=905142.858 cm3
(c)
r=60cm ,h of cone =120 cm
volume of cone = 1/3 π r2 h= =452571.429 cm3
OR
r=60cm ,h=180cm ,

Long Answer Type Question(2 questions)
Example 1. Two cubes, each of volume 64 cm3 are joined end to end. Find the surface area of the resulting
cuboid.
Solution: Let the length of the edge of each of the two cubes be a cm.
Then, volume of each cube = a3 cm3
Now, 𝑎3 = 64
a = 4 cm.
On joining both the cubes, the dimensions of the resulting cuboid
Length (l) = 4 + 4 = 8cm, breadth = 4 cm, height = 4 cm.
So that, surface area of the resulting cuboid = 2(𝑙𝑏 + 𝑏𝑕 + 𝑕𝑙)
= 2(8 𝑥 4 + 4 𝑥 4 + 4 𝑥 8) = 2(32 + 16 + 32)
= 2(80) = 160 𝑐𝑚2
Example 2. A solid toy is in the form of a hemisphere surmounted by a right
circular cone. The height of the cone is 2 cm and the diameter of the base is 4 cm.
Determine the volume of the toy. If a right circular cylinder circumscribes the toy,
find the difference of the volumes of the cylinder and the toy. (Take π = 3.14)
Solution: Let BPC be the hemisphere and ABC be the cone standing on the base of
the hemisphere. The radius BO of the hemisphere (as well as of the cone) = 1/2 × 4 cm = 2 cm.

= 3 x 3.14 x (2)3 + 3 x 3.14 (2)2 x 2 = 25.12 cm3
Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of the base of the right
circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is
EH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm
So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy
= 3.14 (2)2 x 4 – 25.12 = 25.12 cm3
Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Experimental or empirical probability P (E) of an event E is
P (E)=

Number of trials in which the event happened
Total number of trials

The theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event A,
written as P(A), is defined as
𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑢𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑚𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝐴
P(A) =
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠

Two or more events of an experiment, where occurrence of an event prevents
occurrences of all other events, are called Mutually Exclusive Events.
COMPLIMENTARYEVENTSANDPROBABILITY
___

We denote the event 'notE' by E . This is called the complement event of event E.
So,P(E)+P(notE)=1
i.e., P(E) + P(not E ) = 1, which gives us P(not E ) =1 −P(E).In general, it is true that
for an event E,P (E) =1–P(not E)

 The probability of an event which is impossible tooccuris0.Such an event is called an
Impossible event.

 The probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event
is called a sure event or a certain event.

 The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that 0≤ P(E)≤1
 An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the
probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.
DECKOF CARDSANDPROBABILITY
A deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13
cards each. They are black spades(♠) red hearts (♥),red diamonds (♦) and black
clubs (♣).
The cards in each suit are Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.
Kings, Queens and Jacks are called face cards.

Equally likely events: Two or more events are said to be equally likely if each one
79

of them has an equal chance of occurrence.
Mutually Exclusive events: Two or more events are mutually exclusive if the
occurrence of each event prevents the every other event.
Complementary events: Consider an event has few outcomes. Event of all other
outcomes in the sample survey which are not in the favorable event is called
Complementary event.
Exhaustive events: All the events are exhaustive events if their union is the sample space.
Sure events: The sample space of a random experiment is called sure or certain
event as any one of its elements will surely occur in any trail of the experiment.
Impossible event: An event which will occur on any account is called an impossible event.

1. In a formula racing competition, the time taken by two racing cars A and B to complete 1 round of
the track is 30 minutes and p minutes respectively. If the cars meet again at the starting point for the
first time after 90 minutes and the HCF (30, p) = 15, then the value of p is
(a)45 minutes
(b)60 minutes
(c)75 minutes
(d)180 minutes
Ans: (a)45 minutes
LCM = 90 and HCF = 15
We know that HCF x LCM = Product of two numbers
⇒ 15 x 90 = 30 x p
⇒ p = 45
2. The solution of the following pair of equation is:
x – 3y = 2, 3x – y = 14
(a) x = 5, y = 1 (b) x = 2, y = 3
(c) x = 1, y = 2
Ans: (a) x = 5, y = 1
Given, equations are x – 3y = 2 …(i)
and 3x – y = 14 …(ii)
Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get y = 1
x = 2 + 3y = 2 + 3 × 1 = 5
Hence, x = 5 and y = 1

(d) x = 1, y = 4

3. If two positive integers a and b are written as a = x3y2 and b = xy3, where x and y are prime
numbers, then the HCF (a, b) is:
(a) xy
(b) xy2
(c) x3y3
(d) x2y2
3 2
3
Ans: (b) Here, a = x y and b = xy
⇒ a = x × x × x × y × y and b = xy × y × y
∴ HCF(a, b) = x × y × y = x × y2 = xy2

(a) 7
(b) 14
(c) 21
(d) 28
Ans: (b) 14
Total number of eggs = 400
Probability of getting a bad egg P(E) = 0.035
Consider x as the number of bad eggs
P(E) = Number of bad eggs/ Total number of eggs
Substituting the values
0.035 = x/400 ⇒ 35/1000 = x/400 ⇒ x = 35/1000 x 400
⇒ x = 140/10 ⇒ x = 14

(b) 7.5 cm
(c) 5 cm
(d) 2.5 cm

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 4-

Ans: (c) 5 cm
we know that radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact
⇒ OP ⊥ AP and OQ ⊥ AQ
Also sum of all angles of a quadrilateral is 360°
⇒∠O + ∠P + ∠A + ∠Q = 360°
⇒∠O + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°
⇒∠O = 360° – 270° = 90°
Thus ∠O = ∠P = ∠A = ∠Q = 90° and OP = OQ (radii)
⇒ OPAQ is a square
⇒ radius = OP = OQ = AP = AQ = 5 cm

Direction : In the question number 19 & 20 , A statement of Assertion (A) is followed by a
statement of Reason(R) . Choose the correct option
19. Assertion (A): If x = 2 sin2θ and y = 2 cos2θ + 1 then the value of x + y = 3.
Reason (R): For any value of θ, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
Ans: We know that for any value of θ, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
So, Reason is correct.
For assertion: We have x = 2 sin2θ and y = 2 cos2θ + 1
Then, x + y = 2 sin2θ + 2 cos2θ + 1
= 2(sin2θ + cos2θ) + 1
= 2 x 1 + 1 [∵ sin2θ + cos2θ = 1]
= 2 + 1 = 3.
Hence, Assertion is also correct.
Correct option is (a) Both assertion (A) and reason (R) are true and reason (R) is the correct
explanation of assertion (A).
20. Assertion (A): The length of the minute hand of a clock is 7 cm. Then the area swept by the

Two concentric circles are of radii 8 cm and 5 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle
which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: Let O be the center of the concentric circle.

Let AB be the chord of larger circle touching the smaller circle at P.
Here, OA = 8 cm, OP = 5 cm
Since AB is tangent of P to the smaller circle and OP is the radius of the smaller circle.
∴ OP ⊥ AB.
In right triangle APO, we have
OA2 = AP2 + OP2 ⇒ (8)2 = AP2 + (5)2 ⇒ AP2 = 64 – 25 = 39

27. If PQ is a tangent drawn from an external point P to a circle with centre O and QOR is a diameter
where length of QOR is 8 cm such that ∠POR = 120°, then find OP and PQ.
Ans: Let O be the centre and QOR = 8 cm is diameter of a circle.
PQ is tangent such that ∠POR = 120°.

Now, OQ = OR = 8/2 = 4 cm
∠POQ = 180° – 120° = 60° (Linear pair)
Also OQ ⊥ PQ
Now, in right ΔPOQ,
cos 60° = OQ/PO ⇒ 1/2 = OQ/PO
⇒ 1/2 = 4/PO ⇒ PO = 8 cm
Again, tan 60° = PQ/OQ ⇒ √3 = PQ/4
⇒ PQ = 4√3 cm.

30. Solve the following linear equations:
152x – 378y = –74 and –378x + 152y = –604
Ans: We have, 152x – 378y = –74 ...(i)
–378x + 152y = –604 ...(ii)
Adding equation (i) and (ii), we get
⇒ –226(x +y) = –678
⇒ x + y = 3 …(iii)
Subtracting equation (ii) from (i), we get
530x – 530y = 530
⇒ x – y = 1 …(iv)
Adding equations (iii) and (iv), we get 2x = 4 ⇒ x = 2
Putting the value of x in (iii), we get
2+y=3⇒y=1
Hence, the solution of given system of equations is x = 2, y = 1.
31. The sum of the 5th and the 9th terms of an AP is 30. If its 25th term is three times its 8th term, find

Ans: According to question, a5 + a9 = 30
⇒ (a + 4d) + (a + 8d) = 30
⇒ 2a + 12d = 30 ⇒ a + 6d = 15
⇒ a = 15 – 6d ...(i)
Also, a25 = 3a8 ⇒ a + 24d = 3(a + 7d)
⇒ a + 24d = 3a + 21d ⇒ 2a = 3d
Putting the value of a form (i), we have
2 (15 – 6d) = 3d ⇒ 30 – 12d = 3d

32. From a solid cylinder whose height is 2.4 cm and diameter 1.4 cm, a conical cavity of the same
height and same diameter is hollowed out. Find the total surface area of the remaining solid to the
nearest cm2.
Ans: We have, Radius of the cylinder = 1.4/2 = 0.7 cm
Height of the cylinder = 2.4 cm
Also, radius of the cone = 0.7 cm
and height of the cone = 2.4 cm

Now, slant height of the cone = l
Now, l2 = (0.7)2+(2.4)2
⇒ l2 = 0.49 + 5.76 = 6.25 ⇒ l = 2.5 cm
∴ Total surface area of the remaining solid
= CSA of cylinder + CSA of the cone + area of upper circular base of cylinder
= 2πrh + πrl + πr2 = πr(2h + l + r)

which touches the smaller circle.
Ans: Let O be the centre of the concentric circle of radii 5 cm and 3 cm respectively. Let AB be a
chord of the larger circle touching the smaller circle at P

Then AP = PB and OP⊥AB
Applying Pythagoras theorem in △OPA, we have
OA2 = OP2 + AP2 ⇒ 25 = 9 + AP2

26. Four bells toll at an interval of 8, 12, 15 and 18 seconds respectively. All the four begin to toll
together. Find the number of times they toll together in one hour excluding the one at the start.
Ans: Prime factorisation of the given numbers are:
8 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 23
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 22 × 31
15 = 3 × 5 = 31 × 51
18 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 21 × 32
LCM (8, 12, 15 and 18) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 8 × 9 × 5 = 360 sec = 6 min
∴ Four bells toll together in one hour = 60 ÷ 6 = 10 times.

Find the quadratic polynomial sum and product of whose zeros are –1 and –20 respectively. Also
find the zeroes of the polynomial so obtained.
Ans: Let α and β be the zeros of the quadratic polynomial.
∴ Sum of zeros, α + β = – 1
and product of zeros, α. β = – 20
Now, quadratic polynomial be
x2 – (α + β) . x + α β = x2 –(–1) x – 20 = x2 + x – 20

Now, for zeroes of this polynomial
x2 + x – 20 = 0 ⇒ x2 + 5x – 4x – 20 = 0
⇒ x(x + 5) – 4 (x + 5) = 0 ⇒ (x + 5) (x – 4) = 0
⇒ x = – 5, 4
∴ zeroes are – 5 and 4
28. The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth
is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area
increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
Ans: Let length and breadth be x and y , Area = xy
1st condition: ( x – 5 ) ( y + 3 ) = xy – 9
⇒ 3x – 5y = 6
2nd condition: ( x + 3 ) ( y + 2 ) = xy + 67
⇒ 2x + 3y = 61
Solve 1st and 2nd equations, we get x = 17 and y = 9
Hence, Length of rectangle = 17 units and breadth of rectangle = 9 units
29. In the below figure, XY and X′Y′ are two parallel tangents to a circle with centre O and another
tangent AB with point of contact C intersecting XY at A and X′Y′ at B. Prove that ∠AOB = 90°.

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC

In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7-

Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.

Ans: AC is tangent to circle with centre O.
Thus ∠ACO = 90°

31. Two dice are thrown at the same time. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers
appearing on the top of the dice is (i) 5? (ii) 10? (iii) at least 9?
Ans: Total number of outcomes = 36
(i) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is 5 = 4
∴ Required Probability = 4/36 = 1/9
(ii) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is 10 = 3
∴ Required Probability = 3/36 = 1/12
(i) Number of outcomes in which the sum of the two numbers is at least 9 = 10
∴ Required Probability = 10/36 = 5/18

32. A motor boat whose speed is 18 km/h in still water takes 1 hour more to go 24 km upstream than to
return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
Ans: Let the speed of the stream be x km/h.
Therefore, the speed of the boat upstream = (18 – x) km/h and the speed of the boat downstream =
(18 + x) km/h.
24
The time taken to go upstream = distance/speed =
18  x
24
Similarly, the time taken to go downstream =
18  x
24

According to the question,

1
18  x 18  x
24(18 + x) – 24(18 – x) = (18 – x) (18 + x)
x2 + 48x – 324 = 0
x = 6 or – 54
Since x is the speed of the stream, it cannot be negative. So, we ignore the root x = – 54. Therefore,
x = 6 gives the speed of the stream as 6 km/h.
OR
An express train takes 1 hour less than a passenger train to travel 132 km between Mysore and
Bangalore (without taking into consideration the time they stop at intermediate stations). If the
average speed of the express train is 11km/h more than that of the passenger train, find the average
speed of the two trains.
Ans: Ans: Let the average speed of the passenger train = x km/hour
And the average speed of the express train = (x + 11) km/hour.
132
The time taken by the passenger train =

⇒ x2 + 11x −1452 = 0
⇒ (x − 33)(x + 44) = 0 ⇒ x = 33, x = − 44
The speed cannot be negative, so the speed of the passenger train is 33 km/hour and the speed of the express
train is 33 + 11 = 44 km/ hour.

⇒ 52 = (-1 - 2)2 + (x + 2)2 ⇒ 25 = (-3)2 + (x + 2)2
⇒ 25 = 9 + x2 + 4 + 4x ⇒ 25 = x2 + 4x + 13
⇒ x2 + 4x + 13 - 25 = 0 ⇒ x2 + 4x - 12 = 0
⇒ x2 + 6x - 2x - 12 = 0 ⇒ x(x + 6) - 2(x + 6) = 0
⇒ (x + 6)(x - 2) = 0

Ans: Let PA be the tangent to the circle of point A.

Here, OP = 20 cm and OA = 12 cm
Since PA is tangent of A, therefore OA = PA.
In right angled triangle ∆OAB, OP2 = PA2 + OA2 (Using Pythagoras Theorem)
⇒ (20)2 = PA2 + (12)2 ⇒ PA2 = 400 –144 = 256

A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/h faster, it
would have taken 4 hours less than the scheduled time. And, if the train were slower by 6 km/hr; it
would have taken 6 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.
Ans: Let the actual speed of the train be x km/hr and let the actual time taken be y hours.
Distance covered is xy km If the speed is increased by 6 km/hr, then time of journey is reduced by 4
hours i.e., when speed is (x+6)km/hr, time of journey is (y−4) hours.
∴ Distance covered = (x + 6)(y − 4)
⇒ xy = (x + 6)(y − 4) ⇒ −4x + 6y − 24 = 0 ⇒ −2x + 3y −12 = 0
………….(i)
Similarly xy = (x − 6)(y + 6) ⇒ 6x − 6y − 36 = 0 ⇒ x − y − 6 = 0
…………(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii) we get x=30 and y=24
Putting the values of x and y in equation (i), we obtain
Distance = (30 × 24)km =720km.
Hence, the length of the journey is 720km.
27. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that 2 + 5√3 is irrational.
Ans: Let us assume 2 + 5√3 is rational, then it must be in the form of p/q where p and q are coprime integers and q ≠0
i.e 2 + 5√3 = p/q
p  2q
So √3 =
…(i)
5q
Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0, RHS of equation (i) is rational.
But LHS of (i) is √3 which is irrational. This is not possible. This contradiction has arisen due to
our wrong assumption that 2 + 5√3 is
rational
So, 2 + 5√3 is irrational.

31. In the given figure, AB is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents to the
circle at A and B intersect at P. Find the length of AP.

Ans: AB = 8 cm ⇒ AM = 4 cm
∴ OM = √(52 – 42) = 3 cm

Let AP = y cm, PM = x cm
∴ ∆OPA is a right angle triangle
∴ OP2 = OA2 + AP2
(x + 3)2 = y2 + 25
⇒ x2 + 9 + 6x = y2 + 25 ...(i)
Also, x2 + 42 = y2 ...(ii)
⇒ x2 + 6x + 9 = x2 + 16 + 25
⇒ 6x = 32

AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)

so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT)

Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰

36. Aditya is a fitness freak and great athlete. He always wants to make his nation proud by winning
medals and prizes in the athletic activities.

An upcoming activity for athletes was going to be organised by Railways. Aditya wants to
participate in 200 m race. He can currently run that distance in 51 seconds. But he wants to increase
his speed, so to do it in 31 seconds. With each day of practice, it takes him 2 seconds less.
(i) He wants to makes his best time as 31 sec. In how many days will be able to achieve his target?
(ii) What will be the difference between the time taken on 5th day and 7th day.
OR
(ii) Which term of the arithmetic progression 3, 15, 27, 39 .... will be 120 more than its 21st term?
Ans: Ans:
(i) Let, the number of days taken to achieve the target be n.
In the given A.P., a = 51, d = – 2
Since an = a + (n – 1)d ⇒ 31 = 51 + (n – 1)(– 2)
⇒ 31 – 51 = (n – 1)(– 2) ⇒ – 20 = (n – 1) (– 2)
⇒ (n – 1) = 10 ⇒ n = 11
Hence, 11 days are needed to achieve the target.
(ii) a5 = a + 4d = 51 + 4(– 2) = 51 – 8 = 43 sec
a7 = a + 6d = 51 + 6(– 2) = 51 – 12 = 39 sec
Now, time difference = 43 – 39 = 4 sec.
OR
(ii) We have, a = 3 and d = 12
∴ a21 = a + 20d = 3 + 20 × 12 = 243
Let nth term of the given AP be 120 more than its 21st term. Then, an = 120 + a21
⇒ 3 + (n – 1)d = 120 + 243
⇒ 3 + 12(n – 1) = 363 ⇒ 12(n – 1) = 360
⇒ n – 1 = 30 ⇒ n = 31
Hence, 31st term of the given AP is 120 more than its 21st term.

1. The point on the x-axis which is equidistant from (– 4, 0) and (10, 0) is:
(a) (7, 0)
(b) (5, 0)
(c) (0, 0)
(d) (3, 0)
Ans. (d) (3, 0)
2. If a cylinder is covered by two hemispheres shaped lid of equal shape, then the total curved surface
area of the new object will be
(a) 4πrh + 2πr2
(b) 4πrh – 2πr2
(c) 2πrh + 4πr2
(d) 2πrh + 4πr
Ans: (c) 2πrh + 4πr2
Curved surface area of cylinder = 2πrh
The curved surface area of hemisphere = 2πr2
Here, we have two hemispheres.
So, total curved surface area = 2πrh + 2(2πr2) = 2πrh + 4πr2

5. The values of k for which the quadratic equation 2x2 – kx + k = 0 has equal roots is
(a) 0 only
(b) 8 only
(c) 0,8
(d) 4
Ans: (c) 0,8
For equal roots, D = b2 – 4ac = 0
⇒ (-k)2 – 4(2)(k) = 0
⇒ k2 – 8k = 0 ⇒ k(k – 8) = 0 ⇒ k= 0,8
6. A number x is chosen at random from the numbers -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 the probability that |x| < 2 is

Total possible number of events (n) = 7
Now for |x| < 2, possible values of x = -1, 0, 1
∴ Required probability = 3/7
7. If x = 2sin2θ and y = 2cos2θ + 1 then x + y is:
(a) 3
(b) 2
Ans: (a) 3

(c) 1

8. If ½ is a root of the equation x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0, then the value of k is
(a) 2
(b) – 2
(c) ¼
(d) ½
Ans: (a) 2
If ½ is a root of the equation
x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0 then, substituting the value of ½ in place of x should give us the value of k.
Given, x2 + kx – 5/4 = 0 where, x = ½
(½)2 + k (½) – (5/4) = 0
⇒ (k/2) = (5/4) – ¼ ⇒ k = 2

(a) a unique solution
(b) exactly two solutions
(c) infinitely many solutions
(d) no solution
Ans: (d) no solution
a1 = 1; b1 = 2; c1 = 5
a2 = -3; b2 = -6; c2 = 1
a1/a2 = -1/3
b1/b2 = -2/6 = -1/3
c1/c2 = 5/1 = 5
Here, a1/a2 = b1/b2 ≠ c1/c2
Therefore, the pair of equation has no solution.
10. The point which lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining point A (–2, –5) and
B (2, 5) is:
(a) (0, 0)
(b) (0, –1)

being a face card is
(a) 3/13
(b) 4/13
(c) 6/13
(d) 9/13
Ans: (a) 3/13
Total number of outcomes = 52
Number of face cards = 12
The probability of its being a face card = 12/52 = 3/13
12. The ratio in which the line segment joining the points P(-3, 10) and Q(6, –8) is divided by O(-1, 6)
is:
(a) 1:3
(b) 3:4
(c) 2:7
(d) 2:5
Ans: (c) 2:7
Let k :1 be the ratio in which the line segment joining P( -3, 10) and Q(6, -8) is divided by point O(1, 6).
By the section formula, we have -1 = ( 6k – 3)/(k + 1)
⇒ –k – 1 = 6k – 3
⇒ 7k = 2 ⇒ k = 2/7
Hence, the required ratio is 2:7.

⇒ 3x2 – 12x - x + 4 = 0 ⇒ 3x(x – 4) – 1(x – 4) = 0
⇒ (x – 4)(3x – 1) = 0 ⇒ x = 4, 1/3
Neglecting x = 1/3 as AD will become negative, we have x = 4
So, A is false but R is true.
SECTION-B
Questions 21 to 25 carry 2M each
21. Find the value of m for which the pair of linear equations:
2x + 3y – 7 = 0 and (m – 1) x + (m + 1) y = (3m – 1) has infinitely many solutions
Ans: For infinitely many solutions the condition is

m  1 m  1 3m  1
Now, 2(m + 1) = 3(m – 1) ⇒ m = 5
and 3(3m – 1) = 7(m + 1) ⇒ m = 5
Hence, for m = 5, the system has infinitely many solutions.
22. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomials p(t) = 5t2 + 12t + 7 and verify the relationship between
the zeroes and the coefficients.
Ans: 5t2 + 12t + 7 = 0 ⇒ 5t2 + 5t + 7t + 7 = 0
⇒ 5t (t + 1) + 7(t + 1) = 0 ⇒ (t + 1)(5t + 7) = 0
⇒ t + 1 = 0 ⇒ t = -1
5t + 7 = 0 ⇒ 5t = -7 ⇒ t = -7/5
Therefore, zeroes are (-7/5) and -1
Now, Sum of the zeroes = – (coefficient of x) ÷ coefficient of x2
α + β = – b/a
⇒ (- 1) + (- 7/5) = – (12)/5
⇒ – 12/5 = – 12/5
Product of the zeroes = constant term ÷ coefficient of x2
α β = c/a
⇒ (- 1)(- 7/5) = 7/5
⇒ 7/5 = 7/5

23. Two dice are thrown at the same time. Find the probability of getting (i) same number on both dice
(ii) different numbers on both dice.
Ans: Total number of possible outcomes = 36
(i) Same number on both dice.
Number of possible outcomes = 6
Therefore, the probability of getting same number on both dice = 6/36 = 1/6
(ii) Different number on both dice.
Number of possible outcomes = 36 – 6 = 30
Therefore, the probability of getting different number on both dice = 30/36 = 5/6
OR
Cards marked with number 3, 4, 5, …, 50 are placed in a box and mixed thoroughly. A card is
drawn at random from the box. Find the probability that the selected card bears (i) a perfect square
number (ii) a single digit number
Ans: Total number of cards = 48
(i) Total number of perfect squares = 6
∴ Required Probability = 6/48 = 1/8
(ii) Total single digit numbers = 7
∴ Required Probability = 7/48
24. A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC.
Ans: We know that the lengths of tangents drawn from an exterior point to a circle are equal.

AP = AS ... (i) [tangents from A]
BP = BQ ... (ii) [tangents from B]
CR = CQ ... (iii) [tangents from C]
DR = DS ... (iv) [tangents from D]
AB + CD = (AP + BP) + (CR + DR)
= (AS + BQ) + (CQ + DS) [using (1), (ii), (iii), (’v)]
= (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
=AD+ BC.
Hence, AB + CD = AD + BC.
25. Find the points on the x–axis which are at a distance of 2√5 from the point (7, –4). How many such
points are there?
Ans: Let coordinates of the point=(x, 0)(given that the point lies on x axis)
x1 = 7, y1=-4and x2 = x, y2=0
Distance =√(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2
According to the question, 2√5=√(x – 7)2+ (0 – 4(-4))2
Squaring L.H.S and R.H.S, we get 20 = x2 + 49 – 14x + 16
⇒ 20=x2 + 65 – 14x ⇒ x2 – 14x + 45 = 0 ⇒ x2 – 9x – 5x + 45 = 0
⇒ x(x – 9) – 5(x – 9) = 0 ⇒ (x – 9) (x – 5) = 0 ⇒ x – 9 = 0, x – 5 = 0
⇒ x = 9 or x = 5

26. On a morning walk, three persons step off together and their steps measure 40 cm, 42 cm and 45
cm, respectively. Find the minimum distance each should walk so that each can cover the same
distance in complete steps.
Ans: Step measures of three persons are 40 cm, 42 cm and 45 cm.
The minimum distance each should walk so that each can cover the same distance in complete steps
is the LCM of 40 cm, 42 cm and 45 cm.
Prime factorisation of 40, 42 and 45 gives
40 = 23 × 5, 42 = 2 × 3 × 7, 45 = 32 × 5
LCM (40, 42, 45) = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved in the numbers
= 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 = 8 × 9 × 35 = 72 × 35 = 2520 cm.

Show that 5 + 2√7 is an irrational number, where √7 is given to be an irrational number.
Ans: Let 5 + 2√7 is a rational number such that
5 + 2√7 = a, where a is a rational number
a 5
⇒ 2√7 = a – 5 ⇒ 7 
2
a 5
Since a is a rational number and 2, 5 are integers, therefore
is a rational number
2
⇒ √7 is a rational number which contradicts the fact that √7 is an irrational number
Therefore, our assumption is wrong
Hence, 5 + 2√7 is an irrational number
27. From a point on a ground, the angle of elevation of bottom and top of a transmission tower fixed on
the top of a 20 m high building are 45° and 60° respectively. Find the height of the tower.

D is the point on the ground from where the angles of elevation of the bottom B and the top A of
the transmission tower AB are 45° and 60° respectively.
The distance of the point of observation D from the base of the building C is CD.
Combined height of the building and tower = AC = AB + BC
In ΔBCD, tan 45° = BC/CD
⇒ 1 = 20/CD
⇒ CD = 20
In ΔACD, tan 60° = AC/CD
⇒ √3 = AC/20
⇒ AC = 20√3
Height of the tower, AB = AC - BC
⇒ AB = 20√3 - 20 m = 20 (√3 - 1) m
28. In the below figure, if ∠1 =∠2 and ΔNSQ = ΔMTR, then prove that ΔPTS ~ ΔPRQ.

Ans: According to the question, ∆ NSQ ≅ ∆MTR and ∠1 = ∠2
Since, ∆NSQ = ∆MTR
So, SQ = TR ….(i)
Also, ∠1 = ∠2 ⇒ PT = PS….(ii) [sides opposite to equal angles]
From Equation (i) and (ii),
PS/SQ = PT/TR
⇒ ST || QR (By converse of basic proportionality theorem)
∴ ∠1 = ∠PQR and ∠2 = ∠PRQ (corresponding angles)
In ∆PTS and ∆PRQ.
∠P = ∠P [Common angles]
∠1 = ∠PQR (proved)
∠2 = ∠PRQ (proved)
∴ ∆PTS – ∆PRQ [By AAA similarity criteria]
Hence proved

30. If 2x + y = 23 and 4x – y = 19, find the values of 5y – 2x and y/x – 2.
Ans: Given equations are 2x + y = 23 …(i)
4x – y = 19 …(ii)
On adding both equations, we get 6x = 42
⇒x=7
Put the value of x in Eq. (i), we get
2(7) + y = 23
⇒ y = 23 – 14
⇒y=9
Hence 5y – 2x = 5(9) – 2(7) = 45 – 14 = 31
y/x – 2 = 9/7 -2 = -5/7
31. In the given figure, OP is equal to diameter of the circle. Prove that ABP is an equilateral triangle.

Ans: Join OP and let it meets the circle at point Q.
Since OP = 2r (Diameter of the circle)
⇒ OQ = QP = r
Consider ΔAOP in which OA ⊥ AP and OP is the hypotenuse.
∴ OQ = AQ = OA
(Mid-point of the hypotenuse is equidistant from the vertices)
⇒ OAQ is an equilateral triangle.
⇒ ∠AOQ = 60° (Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°)

Consider right-angled triangle OAP.
∠AOQ = 60° (Proved above)
∠OAP = 90° ⇒ ∠APO = 30°
∠APB = 2∠APO = 2 × 30° = 60°
Also PA = PB (Tangents to a circle from an external point are equal.)
⇒ ∠PAB = ∠PBA (Angles opposite to equal sides in ΔPAB)
In ΔABP, ∠APB = 60°

is cut, drilled and has holes punched in it. It is then fine polished using sandpaper. For the retail
packaging and delivery activity center, the polished wood sub-parts are assembled together, then
decorated using paint. The total height of the toy is 26 cm and the height of its conical part is 6 cm.
The diameters of the base of the conical part is 5 cm and that of the cylindrical part is 3 cm. On the
basis of the above information, answer the following questions:

Ans: Let the radius of cone be r, slant height of cone be l, height of cone be h, radius of cylinder be
r′ and height of cylinder be h′.
Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r′ = 1.5 cm, h′ = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and
Slant height, l  r 2  h 2  2.52  62  6.25  36  42.25  6.5cm
(a) Area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder + area of one base of the cylinder
= 2πr′h′ + π(r′)2 = πr′ (2h′ + r′) = (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm2
= 4.71 × 41.5 cm2
= 195.465 cm2
(b) Area to be painted green = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone – base area of the cylinder
= πrl + πr2 – π(r′)2 = π[(2.5 × 6.5) + (2.5)2 – (1.5)2] cm2
= π[20.25] cm2 = 3.14 × 20.25 cm2
= 63.585 cm2

38. Mohan is an auto driver. His autorickshaw was too old and he had to spend a lot of money on repair
and maintenance every now and then. One day he got to know about the EV scheme of the
Government of India where he can not only get a good exchange bonus but also avail heavy
discounts on the purchase of an electric vehicle. So, he took a loan of 71,18,000 from a reputed
bank and purchased a new autorickshaw.
Mohan repays his total loan of 118000 rupees by paying every month starting with the first
instalment of 1000 rupees.

(i) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount will be paid by him
in the 30th instalment? [1]
(ii) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount of loan does he still
have to pay after 30th instalment? [2]
OR
(ii)If he increases the instalment by 200 rupees every month, then what amount would he pay in
40th instalment? [2]
(iii) If he increases the instalment by 100 rupees every month, then what amount will be paid by
him in the 100th instalment [1]
Ans: (i) Clearly, the amount of installment in the first month = Rs. 1000, which increases by Rs.
100 every month
therefore, installment amount in second month = Rs. 1100, third month = Rs. 1200, fourth month =
Rs. 1300 .....
which forms an AP, with first term, a = 1000 and common difference, d = 1100 - 1000 = 100
Now, amount paid in the 30th installment,
a30 = 1000 + (30 - 1)100 = 3900 [∵ an = a + (n - 1)d]
(ii) Amount paid in 30 instalments,
30
S30 =
[2 x 1000 + (30 - 1)100] = 73500
2
Hence, remaining amount of loan that he has to pay = 118000 - 73500 = Rs. 44500
OR
If he increases the instalment by 200 rupees every month, amount would he pay in 40th instalment
Then a = 1000, d = 200 and n= 40
a40 = a + 39d
⇒ a40 = 1000 + 39(200)
⇒ a40 = 880
(iii) Here, a = 1000 and common difference, d = Rs. 100
Amount paid in the 100th instalments
a100 = 1000 + (100 - 1)100 = 10900 [∵ an = a + (n - 1)d]

1. Three cubes each of side 15 cm are joined end to end. The total surface area of the cuboid is:
(a) 3150 cm2
(b) 1575 cm2
(c) 1012.5 cm2
(d) 576.4 cm2
2
Ans. (a) 3150 cm
2. The midpoint of a line segment joining two points A(2, 4) and B(-2, -4) is
(a) (-2, 4)
(b) (2, -4)
(c) (0, 0)
(d) (-2, -4)
Ans: (c) (0, 0)
As per midpoint formula, we know;
x-coordinate of the midpoint = [2 + (-2)]/2 = 0/2 = 0
y-coordinate of the midpoint = [4 + (-4)]/2=0/2=0
Hence, (0, 0) is the midpoint of AB.

(a) 2
(b) -2
(c) 1

Ans: (a) 2
( x2  x1 ) 2  ( y2  y1 ) 2  5  (1  2) 2  ( x  2) 2  5  9  ( x  2) 2  5

⇒ 9 + (x + 2)2 = 25
⇒ (2 + x)2 = 16 ⇒ 2 + x = 4 ⇒ x = 2

21 = 3 × 7
15 = 3 × 5
So, HCF = 3; LCM = 22 × 3 × 7 i.e., 420
7. If the sum of LCM and HCF of two numbers is 1260 and their LCM is 900 more than their HCF,
then the product of two numbers is
(a) 205400
(b) 203400
(c) 194400
(d) 198400
Ans: (c) 194400
Let the HCF of the numbers be x and their LCM be y.
It is given that the sum of the HCF and LCM is 1260, therefore
x + y = 1260 ....(i)
And, LCM is 900 more than HCF.
y = x + 900..... (ii)
Substituting (ii) in (i), we get x + x + 900 =1260
⇒ 2x + 900 = 1260
⇒ 2x = 1260 - 900 ⇒ 2x = 360 ⇒ x = 180
Substituting x = 180 in (1), we get:
y = 180 + 900 ⇒ y = 1080
We also know that the product the two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and HCF
Thus, product of the numbers = 1080(180) = 194400
8. If the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 + (a + 1)x + b are 2 and -3, then
(a) a = -7, b = -1

the measure of AB is

(a) 37 cm
(b) 16cm
(c) 30 cm
(d) 39 cm
Ans: (c) 30 cm

⇒ AP = 14cm
Now, CR = CS = 23 cm [Tangents from an external point to a circle are equal]
∴ BS = 39 - 23 = 16cm
And BS = BP = 16 cm [Tangents from an external point to a circle are equal]
Now, AB = AP + BP = 14 + 16 = 30cm

Questions 21 to 25 carry 2M each
21. A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC.

Ans: We know that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to the circle
are equal.
DR = DS ...... (i)
BP = BQ ...... (ii)
AP = AS ...... (iii)
CR = CQ ...... (iv)
Adding (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), we get DR + BP + AP + CR = DS + BQ + AS + CQ
By rearranging the terms we get,
(DR + CR) + (BP + AP) = (CQ + BQ) + (DS + AS)
⇒ CD + AB = BC + AD
Hence it is proved AB + CD = AD + BC.

24. Find the value of p if the pair of equations 2x + 3y – 5 = 0 and px – 6y – 8 = 0 has a unique
solution.
Ans: Given, pair of linear equations is 2x + 3y – 5 = 0 and px – 6y – 8 = 0
On comparing with ax + by + c = 0 we get
Here, a1 = 2, b1 = 3, c1 = – 5;
And a2 = p, b2 = – 6, c2 = – 8;
a1 /a2 = 2/p, b1 /b2 = – 3/6 = – ½, c1 /c2 = 5/8
Since, the pair of linear equations has a unique solution,
∴ a1/a2 ≠ b1/b2
⇒ 2/p ≠ – ½
⇒p≠–4
Hence, the pair of linear equations has a unique solution for all values of p except – 4.

26. 4 Bells toll together at 9.00 am. They toll after 7, 8, 11 and 12 seconds respectively. How many
times will they toll together again in the next 3 hours?
Ans: 7 = 7 × 1
8=2×2×2
11 = 11 × 1
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
∴ LCM of 7, 8, 11, 12 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 = 1848
∴ Bells will toll together after every 1848 sec.

Given that √3 is irrational, prove that (2 + 5√3) is an irrational number.
Ans: Let 2 + 5√3 be a rational number such that
2 + 5√3 = a, where a is a non-zero rational number.
a 2
5 3  a 2  3 
5
a2
Since 5 and 2 are integers and a is a rational number, therefore
is a rational number
5
⇒ √3 is a rational number which contradicts the fact that √3 is an irrational number.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence 2 + 5√3 is an irrational number
27. Find the ratio in which the line 2x + y – 4 = 0 divides the line segment joining the points A (2, –
2) and B (3, 7)
Ans: Let P(x, y) be the point on the line 2x + y – 4 = 0 dividing the line segment joining the
points A(2, –2) and B(3, 7) in the ratio k : 1.

28. In the given figure, PA and PB are the tangent segments to a circle with centre O. Show that the
points A, O, B and P are concyclic.

Ans: Here, OA = OB
And OA ⊥ AP, OB ⊥ BP (tangent ⊥ radius)
∴ ∠OAP = 90°,
∠OBP = 90°
∴ ∠OAP + ∠OBP = 90° + 90° = 180°
∴ ∠AOB + ∠APB = 180°
(Since, ∠AOB + ∠OAP + ∠OBP + ∠APB = 360°)
Thus, sum of opposite angle of a quadrilateral is 180°.
Hence, A, O, B and P are concyclic.
OR
In the given figure, ABC is a triangle in which ∠B = 90°, BC = 48 cm and AB = 14 cm. A circle

Page - 7 -

Ans: In ∆ABC, AC 2  AB 2  BC 2  (14) 2  (48)2  50 cm
∠OQB = 90°⇒ OPBQ is a square ⇒ BQ = r
⇒ QA = 14 - r = AR (tangents from a external point are equal in length)
Again PB = r ⇒ PC = 48 - r
⇒ RC = 48 - r (tangents from a external point are equal in length)
⇒ AR + RC = AC
⇒ 14 - r + 48 - r = 50
⇒ r = 6cm.
29. From a pack of 52 playing cards, jacks, queens, kings and aces of red colour are removed. From
the remaining a card is drawn at random. Find the probability that the card drawn is (i) a black
queen (ii) a red card (iii) a face card.
Ans: From the total playing 52 cards, red coloured jacks, queen, kings and aces are removed(i.e.,
2 jacks, 2 queens, 2 kings, 2 aces) ∴ Remaining cards = 52 – 8 = 44
(i) Favourable cases for a black queen are 2 (i.e., queen of club or spade)
∴ Probability of drawing a black queen = 2/44 = 1/22
(ii) Favourable cases for red cards are 26 – 8 = 18 (as 8 cards have been removed) (i.e.9 diamonds
+ 9 hearts)
∴ Probability of drawing a red card = 18/44 = 9/22
(iii) Favourable cases for a face card are 6 (i.e. 2 black jacks, queens and kings each)
∴ Probability of drawing a face card = 6/44 = 3/22
30. If a, b are the zeroes of the polynomial 2x2 – 5x + 7, then find a polynomial whose zeroes are 2a

∴a+b=

and ab =
2
2
2
The given zeroes of required polynomial are 2a + 3b and 3a + 2b
5
25
Sum of the zeroes = 2a + 3b + 3a + 2b = 5a + 5b = 5(a + b) = 5 ×
=
2
2
Again, product of the zeroes = (2a + 3b) (3a + 2b) = 6 (a2 + b2) + 13ab
= 6 [(a + b)2 – 2ab)] + 13 ab = 6(a + b)2 + ab
= 6(5/2)2 + 7/2 = 75/2 + 7/2 = 82/2 = 41
Now, required polynomial is given by
25
k [x2 – (Sum of the zeroes) x + Product of the zeroes] = k [ x2 –
x + 41]
2
k
= [2 x 2  25 x  82] , where k is any non-zero real number.

Hence the required polynomial is 2 x 2  25 x  82 .

33. A train, travelling at a uniform speed for 360 km, would have taken 48 minutes less to travel the
same distance if its speed were 5 km/h more. Find the original speed of the train.
Ans: Let original speed of train = x km/h
We know, Time = distance/speed
According to the question, we have Time taken by train = 360/x hour
And, Time taken by train its speed increase 5 km/h = 360/(x + 5)
It is given that,

⇒ x = -50, 45
But x ≠ -50 because speed cannot be negative
So, x = 45 km/h
Hence, original speed of train = 45 km/h

Two water taps together can fill a tank in 6 hours. The tap of larger diameter takes 9 hours less

Solving by cross multiplication, 6(2x − 9) = x2 – 9x
⇒ 12x − 54 = x2 − 9x ⇒ x2 − 9x − 12x + 54 = 0 ⇒ x2 −21x + 54 = 0
⇒ x2−18x−3x+54=0
⇒ x(x − 18) − 3(x − 18)=0
⇒ (x − 18)(x − 3) = 0
⇒ x = 18, x = 3
Neglecting x = 3 as x – 9 can’t negative, therefore x = 18
If we take x = 18
Smaller tap = (x) = 18 hrs
Larger tap = (x – 9) = 18 – 9 = 9hrs
Hence, the time taken by the smaller tap to fill the tank = 18 hrs & the time taken by the larger
tap to fill the tank = 9 hrs
34. 200 logs are stacked in the following manner: 20 logs in the bottom row, 19 in the next row, 18 in
the row next to it and so on (see below figure). In how may rows are the 200 logs placed and how
many logs are in the top row?

Ans: Here, a is the first term, d is a common difference and n is the number of terms.
It can be observed that the number of logs in rows are forming an A.P. 20, 19, 18, ...
n
We know that sum of n terms of AP is given by the formula Sₙ = [2a + (n - 1) d]
2
n
⇒ 200 = [2 × 20 + (n - 1)(- 1)] ⇒ 400 = n [40 - n + 1] ⇒ 400 = n [41 - n]
2
⇒ 400 = 41n - n² ⇒ n² - 41n + 400 = 0 ⇒ n² - 16n - 25n + 400 = 0
⇒ n(n - 16) - 25(n - 16) = 0 ⇒ (n - 16)(n - 25) = 0
⇒ Either (n -16) = 0 or (n - 25) = 0
∴ n = 16 or n = 25
The number of logs in nth row will be aₙ = a + (n - 1) d
⇒ a₁₆ = a + 15d ⇒ a₁₆ = 20 + 15 × (- 1) ⇒ a₁₆ = 20 – 15 ⇒ a₁₆ = 5
Similarly, a₂₅ = 20 + 24 × (- 1)
⇒ a₂₅ = 20 – 24 ⇒ a₂₅ = - 4

Clearly, the number of logs in the 16th row is 5. However, the number of logs in the 25th row is
negative 4, which is not possible.
Therefore, 200 logs can be placed in 16 rows. The number of logs in the top (16th) row is 5.

The sum of the third and the seventh terms of an AP is 6 and their product is 8. Find the sum of
first sixteen terms of the AP.
Ans: Here, a is the first term, d is the common difference and n is the number of terms.
Given: a₃ + a₇ = 6 ----- (1)
a₃ × a₇ = 8 ----- (2)
We know that nth term of AP is aₙ = a + (n - 1)d
Third term, a₃ = a + 2d ----- (3)
Seventh term, a₇ = a + 6d ----- (4)
Using equation (3) and equation (4) in equation (1) to find the sum of the terms,
(a + 2d) + (a + 6d) = 6
⇒ 2a + 8d = 6 ⇒ a + 4d = 3 ⇒ a = 3 - 4d ----- (5)
Using equation (3) and equation (4) in equation (2) to find the product of the terms,
(a + 2d ) × (a + 6d ) = 8
Substituting the value of a from equation (5) above,
(3 - 4d + 2d) × (3 - 4d + 6d) = 8
⇒ (3 - 2d) × (3 + 2d) = 8
⇒ (3)² - (2d)² = 8 [Since (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b² ]
⇒ 9 - 4d² = 8 ⇒ 4d² = 1 ⇒ d² = ¼ ⇒ d = ½, -½

36. Mayank a student of class 7th loves watching and playing with birds of different kinds. One day
he had an idea in his mind to make a bird-bath on his garden. His brother who is studying in class
10th helped him to choose the material and shape of the birdbath. They made it in the shape of a
cylinder with a hemispherical depression at one end as shown in the Figure below. They opted for
the height of the hollow cylinder as 1.45 m and its radius is 30 cm. The cost of material used for
making bird bath is Rs. 40 per square meter.

(i) Find the curved surface area of the hemisphere. (Take π = 3.14)
(ii) Find the total surface area of the bird-bath. (Take π = 22/7)
(iii) What is total cost for making the bird bath?
OR
(iii) Mayank and his brother thought of increasing the radius of hemisphere to 35 cm with same
material so that birds get more space, then what is the new height of cylinder?
Ans: (i) Let r be the common radius of the cylinder and hemisphere and h be the height of the
hollow cylinder.
Then, r = 30 cm and h = 1.45 m = 145 cm.
Curved surface area of the hemisphere = 2πr2
=2 x 3.14 x 302 = 0.56 m2
(ii) Let S be the total surface area of the birdbath.
S = Curved surface area of the cylinder + Curved surface area of the hemisphere
⇒ S = 2πrh+ 2πr2 = 2πr(h + r)

bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two bridge towers connected at the upper
level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping.
In this bridge, two towers of equal heights are standing opposite each other on either side of the
road, which is 80 m wide. During summer holidays, Neeta visited the tower bridge. She stood at
some point on the road between these towers. From that point between the towers on the road, the
angles of elevation of the top of the towers was 60° and 30° respectively.

(i) Find the distances of the point from the base of the towers where Neeta was standing while
measuring the height.

(ii) Neeta used some applications of trigonometry she learned in her class to find the height of the
towers without actually measuring them. What would be the height of the towers she would have
calculated?

38. On the roadway, Points A and B, which stand in for Chandigarh and Kurukshetra, respectively,
are located nearly 90 kilometres apart. At the same time, a car departs from Kurukshetra and one
from Chandigarh. These cars will collide in 9 hours if they are travelling in the same direction,
and in 9/7 hours if they are travelling in the other direction. Let X and Y be two cars that are
travelling at x and y kilometres per hour from places A and B, respectively. On the basis of the
above information, answer the following questions:

In ∆ABP, sin 600 

(a) When both cars move in the same direction, then find the situation can be represented
algebraically.
[2]
OR
(a) When both cars move in the opposite direction, then find the situation can be represented
algebraically.
[2]
(b) Find the speed of car x.
[1]
(c) Find the speed of car y.
[1]
Ans: (a) Suppose two cars meet at point Q. Then, Distance travelled by car X = AQ, Distance
travelled by car Y = BQ. It is given that two cars meet in 9 hours.
∴ Distance travelled by car X in 9 hours = 9x km = AQ = 9x
Distance travelled by car Y in 9 hours = 9y km = BQ = 9y
Clearly, AQ - BQ = AB = 9x - 9y = 90 = x - y = 10
OR
Suppose two cars meet at point P. Then Distance travelled by car X = AP and Distance travelled
by car Y = BP.

Hence, speed of car X is 40 km/hr.
(c) We have x - y = 10 ⇒ 40 - y = 10 ⇒ y = 30
Hence, speed of car y is 30 km/hr

26. A part of monthly hostel charges in a college is fixed and the remaining depends on the number
of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student ‘A’ takes food for 22 days, he has to
pay Rs. 1380 as hostel charges; whereas a student ‘B’, who takes food for 28 days, pays Rs.
1680 as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
Ans: Let the fixed hostel charges be Rs. x and the cost of food per day be Rs. y.
According to the question, we get
x + 22y = 1380 ...(i)
and x + 28y = 1680 ...(ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get
6y = 300 ⇒ y = 300 ÷ 6 = 50
Putting y = 50 in (i), we get
x + 22(50) = 1380 ⇒ x + 1100 = 1380 ⇒ x = 280
∴ Fixed hostel charges = Rs. 280 and cost of the food per day = Rs. 50.

Ans: Let Meena has received x no. of Rs. 50 notes and y no. of Rs. 100 notes.
So, 50x + 100y = 2000 ... (i)
x + y = 25 ... (ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get y = 15
Putting y = 15 in equation (ii), we get
x + 15 = 25

q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p
and q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
28. What number should be added to the polynomial x2 – 5x + 4 so that 3 is the zero of the

Ans: Let k be the number to be added to the given polynomial.
Then the polynomial becomes x2 – 5x + (4 + k)
As 3 is the zero of this polynomial, we get (3)2 – 5(3) + (4 + k) = 0

If cos θ + sin θ = √2 cos θ, show that cos θ – sin θ = √2 sin θ.
Ans: Given, cos θ + sin θ = √2 cos θ
Squaring both sides, we get
(cos θ + sin θ)2 = (√2 cos θ)2
⇒ cos2θ + sin2θ + 2sin θ cos θ
⇒ 2sin θ cos θ = cos2θ – sin2θ

⇒ 2sin θ cos θ = (cos θ – sin θ)(cos θ + sin θ)
⇒ 2sin θ cos θ = (cos θ – sin θ) (√2 cos θ)
⇒ √2 sin θ = cos θ – sin θ ⇒ cos θ – sin θ = √2 sin θ

32. Some students planned a picnic. The total budget for food was Rs. 2,000. But 5 students failed
to attend the picnic and thus the cost of food for each member increased by Rs. 20. How many
students attended the picnic and how much did each student pay for the food?
Ans: Case I. Let number of students = x
and cost of food for each member = Rs. y
Then x × y = 2,000 ...(i)
Case II. New number of students = x – 5
New cost of food for each member = Rs. (y + 20)
Then (x – 5)(y + 20) = 2,000
⇒ xy + 20x – 5y – 100 = 2,000 ...(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x = –20, 25
x = –20 is rejected because number of students can’t be negative.
So, x = 25 ⇒ y = 80
Number of students = 25
Cost of food for each student = Rs. 80.

If Zeba was younger by 5 years than what she really is, then the square of her age (in years)
would have been 11 more than five times her actual age. What is her age now?
Ans: Let the present age of Zeba be x years.
Age before 5 years = (x – 5) years
According to given condition, (x – 5)2 = 5x + 11
⇒ x2 + 25 – 10x = 5x + 11 ⇒ x2 – 10x – 5x + 25 – 11 = 0
⇒ x2 – 15x + 14 = 0 ⇒ x2 – 14x – x + 14 = 0
⇒ x (x – 14) – 1 (x – 14) = 0 ⇒ (x – 1) (x – 14) = 0
⇒ x – 1 = 0 or x – 14 = 0 ⇒ x = 1 or x = 14
But present age cannot be 1 year.
Hence, Present age of Zeba is 14 years.

Saving money is a good habit and it should be inculcated in children from the beginning. A
father brought a piggy bank for his son Aditya. He puts one five-rupee coin of his savings in the
piggy bank on the first day. He increases his savings by one five-rupee coin daily.

(i) If the piggy bank can hold 190 coins of five rupees in all, find the number of days he can
contribute to put the five-rupee coins into it
(ii) Find the total money he saved.
OR
If 6 times the 6th term of an A.P., is equal to 9 times the 9th term, find its 15th term.
Ans: Child's savings day wise are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ....... to n days
We can have at most 190 coins
i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .... to n term = 190
n
⇒ [2  1  ( n  1)1]  190
2
⇒ n(n + 1) = 380 ⇒ n2 + n - 380 = 0
⇒ (n + 20)(n−19) = 0 ⇒ (n + 20)(n - 19) = 0
⇒ n = −20 or n = 19
But number of coins cannot be negative
n = 19 (rejecting n = -20)
So, number of days = 19
Total money she saved = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + ...
= 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + ... upto 19 terms

OR
Let, the first term of A.P. be ‘a’ and its common difference be ‘d’
Given, 6a6 = 9a9
⇒ 6(a + 5d) = 9(a + 8d)
⇒ 6a + 30d = 9a + 72d
⇒ -3a = 42d
⇒ a = -14d
…(i)
Then, 15th term i.e. a15 = a + 14d = -14d + 14d [from (i)]
=0
Hence, 15th term of A.P. is 0.

each incorrect answer, then Yash would have scored 50 marks. How many questions were there in
the test?
Ans: Let x be the number of right answers and y be the number of wrong answers.
According to the question,
3x – y = 40
….(i)
and, 2x – y = 25
….(ii)
On subtraction, we get: x = 15
putting the value of x in (i), we get 3 (15)-y = 40 y = 5
Number of right answers= 15 answers
Number of wrong answers= 5 answers.
Total Number of questions = 5 + 15 = 20
27. Prove that (sinA + cosecA)2 + (cosA + secA)2 = 7 + tan2A + cot2A
Ans: L.H.S = (sinA + cosecA)2 + (cosA + secA)2
=sin2 A + cosec2 A +2sinAcosecA + cos2 A + sec2 A +2cosAsecA
= sin2 A + cos2 A +cosec2 A+sec2 A +2sinA×1/sinA + 2cosA×1/cosA
Since, (sin2 A + cos2 A =1)
(sec2 A =1 + tan2A, cosec2 A = 1 + cot2A)
= 1 + 1 + cot2A +1 + tan2A +2 +2
= 7 + tan2A +cot2A = RHS
28. Prove that √5 is an irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7 -

So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p and
q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
29. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 – 2x – 8 and verify the relationship between the
zeroes and the coefficients of the polynomial.
Ans: Given, f(x)=x2 − 2x – 8
The zeroes of f(x) are given by, f(x) = 0
⇒ x2 + 2x − 4x – 8 = 0 ⇒ x (x + 2) − 4(x + 2) = 0 ⇒ (x + 2) (x − 4) = 0
⇒ x = −2 (or) x = 4
Hence, the zeros of f(x) = x2 − 2x − 8 are α = −2 and β = 4

30. Prove that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
Ans: Given, To Prove, Constructions and Figure – 1½ marks
Correct Proof – 1½ marks
OR
In the figure XY and X'Y' are two parallel tangents to a circle with centre O and another tangent
AB with point of contact C interesting XY at A and X'Y' at B, what is the measure of ∠AOB.

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC

In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 8 -

OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90°
⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.
31. Two dice are thrown at the same time. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers
appearing on the top of the dice is
(i) 8?
(ii) 7?
(iii) less than or equal to 12?
Ans: (i) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers 8 = 5
∴ Required Probability = 5/36
(ii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers 7 = 6
∴ Required Probability = 6/36 = 1/6
(iii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers less than or equal to 12 = 36
∴ Required Probability = 36/36 = 1

33. A person on tour has Rs.360 for his expenses. If he extends his tour for 4 days, he has to cut down
his daily expenses by Rs.3. Find the original duration of the tour.
Ans: Let days be the original duration of the tour.
Total expenditure on tour ₹ 360
Expenditure per day ₹ 360/x
Duration of the extended tour (x + 4) days
Expenditure per day according to the new schedule ₹ 360/(x + 4)

⇒ x² + 24x – 20x – 480 = 0
⇒ x(x + 24) - 20(x + 24) = 0
⇒ x – 20 = 0 or x + 24 = 0
⇒ x = 20 or x = -24
Since the number of days cannot be negative. So, x = 20
Therefore, the original duration of the tour was 20 days
OR
Rs.6500 were divided equally among a certain number of persons. Had there been 15 more

5. The LCM of two numbers is 14 times their HCF. The sum of LCM and HCF is 600. If one
number is 280, then the other number is
(a) 20
(b) 28
(c) 60
(d) 80
Ans: (d) According to the question, LCM + HCF = 600
Since LCM = 14 × HCF
⇒ 14 × HCF + HCF = 600 ⇒ 15 × HCF = 600 ⇒ HCF = 600 ÷ 15 = 40
⇒ LCM = 600 – HCF = 600 – 40 = 560

22. XY and MN are the tangents drawn at the end points of the
diameter DE of the circle with centre O. Prove that XY ||
MN.
Ans: Since, XY is the tangent to the circle at the point D.
⇒ OD ⊥ XY ⇒ ∠EDX = 90°
Also, MN is the tangent to the circle at E.
⇒ OE ⊥ MN ⇒ ∠ DEN = 90°
As, ∠EDX = ∠DEN (each 90°)
which are alternate interior angles.

24. In figure, ABCD is a rectangle. Find the values of x and y.

Ans: AB = DC and BC = AD
⇒ x + y = 30 ...(i)
and x – y = 14 ...(ii)
Adding (i) and (ii), we get 2x = 44 ⇒ x = 22
⇒ y = 30 - 22 = 8
Thus, x = 22 and y = 8
25. Find A and B, if sin (A + 2B) = √3/2 and cos (A + B) = 1/2.
Ans: Given : sin (A + 2B) = sin 60°
⇒ A + 2B = 60° ...(i)
cos (A + B) = cos 60°
⇒ A + B = 60° ...(ii)
Subtracting equation (i) and (ii), we get B = 0°
Putting the value of B in equation (ii), we get,
A = 60° – 0° = 60°
So, A = 60° and B = 0°.
OR
If (1 + cos A) (1 – cos A) = 3/4 , find the value of tan A.
Ans: (1 + cos A) (1 – cos A) = 3/4
⇒ 1 – cos²A = 3/4 ⇒ cos²A = 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 ⇒ cosA = ±1/2
Also, 1 – cos²A = 3/4 ⇒ sin²A = 3/4 ⇒ sinA = ±√3/2
⇒ tanA = sinA/cosA = ±√3

Questions 13 to 22 carry 3 marks each.

26. A part of monthly hostel charges in a college is fixed and the remaining depends on the number
of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student ‘A’ takes food for 22 days, he has to
pay Rs. 1380 as hostel charges; whereas a student ‘B’, who takes food for 28 days, pays Rs.
1680 as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
Ans: Let the fixed hostel charges be Rs. x and the cost of food per day be Rs. y.
According to the question, we get
x + 22y = 1380 ...(i)
and x + 28y = 1680 ...(ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii), we get
6y = 300 ⇒ y = 300 ÷ 6 = 50
Putting y = 50 in (i), we get
x + 22(50) = 1380 ⇒ x + 1100 = 1380 ⇒ x = 280
∴ Fixed hostel charges = Rs. 280 and cost of the food per day = Rs. 50.
OR
The ratio of income of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditure is 4 : 3, if each of
them manage to save Rs. 2000/month. Find their monthly incomes.
Ans: Let the income of first person be 9x and the income of second person be 7x. Further, let
the expenditures of first and second persons be 4y and 3y respectively. Then, Saving of the first
person = 9x – 4y
Saving of the second person = 7x – 3y
According to question,
9x – 4y = 2000 or 9x – 4y – 2000 = 0 ...(i)
and 7x – 3y = 2000 or 7x – 3y – 2000 = 0 ...(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x = 2000 and y = 4000
Thus, monthly income of first person = 9 × 2000 = Rs. 18000
Monthly income of second person = 7 × 4000 = Rs. 28000

28. Prove that √5 is and irrational number.
Ans: Let

5 is a rational number then we have

5

p
, where p and q are co-primes.
q

 p  5q

Squaring both sides, we get p 2  5q 2
 p2 is divisible by 5  p is also divisible by 5
So, assume p = 5m where m is any integer.
Squaring both sides, we get p2 = 25m2
But p 2  5q 2
Therefore, 5q2 = 25m2  q2 = 5m2
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

 q2 is divisible by 5  q is also divisible by 5
From above we conclude that p and q have one common factor i.e. 5 which contradicts that p
and q are co-primes.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence, 5 is an irrational number.
29. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial 6x2 – 7x – 3 and verify the relationship between the

30. Prove that the intercept of a tangent between two parallel tangents to a circle subtends a right
angle at the center
Ans: Given: XY and X'Y' are two parallel tangents to the circle wth centre O and AB is the
tangent at the point C, which intersects XY at A and X'Y' at B.

In ΔOAP and ΔOAC
AP = AC ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO = OC ( Radii of the same circle)
OA = OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP = ΔOAC (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠AOP =∠AOC = ∠1 (CPCT)
Similarly, ∠BOQ =∠BOC = ∠2
Now, POQ is a diameter of the circle.
Hence, it is a straight line.
∴ ∠1 + ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠2 = 180°
2(∠1 + ∠2) = 180°
∴ ∠1 + ∠2 = 90°
∴ ∠AOB = 90°.

In ΔOAP and ΔOAS
AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)
OA=OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT)
⇒ ∠1=∠8
Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰
⇒ 2(∠1) + 2(∠2) + 2(∠5) + 2(∠6) = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1) + (∠2) + (∠5) + (∠6) = 180⁰
∴ ∠AOD + ∠COD=180⁰
Similarly, ∠BOC + ∠DOA = 180⁰

pairs in 2nd row, 7 pairs in 3rd row and so on.

On the basis of above information, answer the following questions.
(i) If she puts a total of 120 pairs of shoes, then find the number of rows required.
(ii) What is the difference of pairs of shoes in 17th row and 10th row.
Ans: Number of pairs of shoes in 1st, 2nd, 3rd row, ... are 3, 5, 7, ...
So, it forms an A.P. with first term a = 3, d = 5 – 3 = 2
(i) Let n be the number of rows required.
∴ Sn = 120 ⇒ (n/2) [2(3) + (n − 1)2] = 120
⇒ n2 + 2n – 120 = 0 ⇒ n2 + 12n – 10n – 120 = 0
⇒ (n + 12) (n – 10) = 0 ⇒ n = 10

37. A 1.2 m tall girl spots a balloon moving with the wind in a horizontal line at a height of 88.2 m
from the ground. The angle of elevation of the balloon from the eyes of the girl at any instant is
60°. After 30 seconds, the angle of elevation reduces to 30° (see the below figure).

Based on the above information, answer the following questions. (Take √3 =1.732)
(i) Find the distance travelled by the balloon during the interval.
(ii) Find the speed of the balloon.
Ans: (i) In the figure, let C be the position of the observer (the girl).
A and P are two positions of the balloon.
CD is the horizontal line from the eyes of the (observer) girl.
Here PD = AB = 88.2 m − 1.2 m = 87 m

Thus, the required distance between the two positions of the balloon = 58 √3 m
= 58 x 1.73 = 100.46 m (approx.)
(ii) Speed of the balloon = Distance/time = 100.46/30 = 3.35 m/s (approx.)

take a position at a particular place. There are two reasons to set a cricket field—to take wickets
and to stop runs being scored.
The following graph shows the position of players during a cricket match.
(i) Find the coordinate of the point on y-axis which are equidistant from the points representing
the players at Cover P(2, –5) and Mid-wicket Q(–2, 9)
(ii) Find the ratio in which x-axis divides the line segment joining the points Extra Cover S(3, –
3) and Fine Leg (–2, 7).

Page - 11 -

Ans: (i) Let A (0, y) be any point on the y-axis.
Since A (0, y) is equidistant from P (2, –5) and Q (–2, 9)
So AP = AQ ⇒ AP2 = AQ2
⇒ (2)2 + (y + 5)2 = (2)2 + (y – 9)2 ⇒ y2 + 10 y + 25 = y2 – 18y + 81
⇒ 28y = 81 – 25 ⇒ 28y = 56
⇒ y = 28/56 = 2
So, the point is (0, 2)
(ii) Let point P(x, 0) divides the line segment joining the points A and B in the ratio k : 1

Hence, the point P divides the line segment in the ratio 3 : 7.

and CE = CF = z cm

Now, x + y = AB = 10 cm
y + z = BC = 12 cm
z + x = CA = 8 cm
Adding all we get 2(x+ y +z) = 30 ⇒ x + y + z = 15
Subtracting, we get z = 5 cm, x = 3 cm and y = 7 cm
Hence, AD = 3 cm, BE = 7 cm and CF = 5 cm.
25. The length of the minute hand of a clock is 6cm. Find the area swept by it when it moves from
5:25 pm to 6:00 pm.
Ans: We know that, in 60 minutes, the tip of minute hand moves 360°
In 1 minute, it will move = 360°/60 = 6°
∴ From 5:25 pm to 6:00 pm i.e. 35 min, it will move through = 35 × 6° = 210°
∴ Area of swept by the minute hand in 35 min = Area of sector with sectorial angle θ of 210°

km/hr; it would have taken 6 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the
journey.
Ans: Let the actual speed of the train be x km/hr and let the actual time taken be y hours.
Distance covered is xy km If the speed is increased by 6 km/hr, then time of journey is reduced
by 4 hours i.e., when speed is (x+6)km/hr, time of journey is (y−4) hours.
∴ Distance covered = (x + 6)(y − 4)
⇒ xy = (x + 6)(y − 4) ⇒ −4x + 6y − 24 = 0 ⇒ −2x + 3y −12 = 0
………….(i)
Similarly xy = (x − 6)(y + 6) ⇒ 6x − 6y − 36 = 0 ⇒ x − y − 6 = 0
…………(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii) we get x=30 and y=24
Putting the values of x and y in equation (i), we obtain
Distance = (30 × 24)km =720km.
Hence, the length of the journey is 720km.

Anuj had some chocolates, and he divided them into two lots A and B. He sold the first lot at the
rate of ₹2 for 3 chocolates and the second lot at the rate of ₹1 per chocolate, and got a total of
₹400. If he had sold the first lot at the rate of ₹1 per chocolate, and the second lot at the rate of
₹4 for 5 chocolates, his total collection would have been ₹460. Find the total number of
chocolates he had.
Ans: Let the number of chocolates in lot A be x
And let the number of chocolates in lot B be y
∴ total number of chocolates =x+y
2
Price of 1 chocolate = ₹ 2/3 , so for x chocolates = x
3
and price of y chocolates at the rate of ₹ 1 per chocolate =y.

4
Similarly, x + y = 460 ⇒ 5x + 4y = 2300 ........ (ii)

Solving (i) and (ii) we get x = 300 and y = 200
∴ x + y = 300 + 200 = 500
So, Anuj had 500 chocolates.

Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0,
RHS of equation (i) is rational.

30. Two coins are tossed simultaneously. What is the probability of getting
(i) At least one head?
(ii) At most one tail?
(iii) A head and a tail?
Ans: Total number of outcomes = 4
(i) Number of outcomes with at least one head = 3
∴ Required probability = 3/4
(ii) Number of outcomes with at most one tail = 3
∴ Required probability = 3/4
(iii)Number of outcomes with a head and a tail = 2
∴ Required probability = 2/4 = 1/2
31. Prove that a parallelogram circumscribing a circle is a rhombus
Ans: We have ABCD, a parallelogram which circumscribes a circle (i.e., its sides touch the
circle) with centre O.
Since tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length,
∴ AP = AS, BP = BQ, CR = CQ and DR = DS
Adding, we get
(AP + BP) + (CR + DR) = (AS + DS) + (BQ + CQ)
⇒ AB + CD = AD + BC
But AB = CD [opposite sides of ABCD]
and BC = AD
∴ AB + CD = AD + BC ⇒ 2 AB = 2 BC
⇒ AB = BC
Similarly AB = DA and DA = CD
Thus, AB = BC = CD = AD
Hence ABCD is a rhombus.

In the figure XY and X'Y' are two parallel tangents to a circle with centre O and another tangent
AB with point of contact C interesting XY at A and X'Y' at B, what is the measure of ∠AOB.

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC

In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)
Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.

Ans: Side of the cubical block (l) = 10 cm.

The hemisphere is surmounted on it.
The largest diameter the hemisphere can have =

26. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that (2 + 5√3) is an irrational number.
Ans: Let 2 + 5√3 be a rational number such that
2 + 5√3 = a, where a is a non-zero rational number.
a2
5 3  a2  3 
5
a2
Since 5 and 2 are integers and a is a rational number, therefore
is a rational number
5
⇒ √3 is a rational number which contradicts the fact that √3 is an irrational number.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong.
Hence 2 + 5√3 is an irrational number
27. Find the zeroes of the polynomial x2 + x – 2, and verify the relation between the coefficients and
the zeroes of the polynomial.

1
(6x2 + x − 12)
6
On factoring, 6x² + x – 12 = 6x² + 9x – 8x – 12
= 3x(2x + 3) - 4(2x + 3)
= (3x - 4)(2x + 3)
So, 1/6 (6x² + 6x - 12) = 0
(3x - 4)(2x + 3) = 0
3x - 4 = 0 ⇒ 3x = 4 ⇒ x = 4/3
2x + 3 = 0 ⇒ 2x = -3 ⇒ x = -3/2
Therefore, the zeros of the polynomial are 4/3 and -3/2.
Sum of the roots:
LHS: + ꞵ =4/3 + (-3/2) = 8 - 9/6 = -1/6
RHS: -coefficient of x/coefficient of x² = -1/6
Product of the roots
LHS: ꞵ = (4/3)(-3/2) = -12/6 = -2
RHS: constant term/coefficient of x² = -12/6 = -2.
Ans: The polynomial can be rewritten as

28. A number consists of two digits. Where the number is divided by the sum of its digits, the quotient
is 7. If 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange their places, find the number.
Ans : Let digit at unit place be x, and at tenth place be y.
∴ Number = 10y + x
10 y  x
 7 ⇒ 6x – 3y = 0
According to the question,
yx
⇒ 2x – y = 0 ...(i)
Again according to the question, (10y + x) – 27 = 10x + y
⇒ 9x – 9y = – 27 ⇒ x – y = – 3 ...(ii)
Solving for x and y, we get
x = 3 and y = 6
∴ Number is 63.

Students of a class are made to stand in rows. If 4 students are extra in a row, there would be two
rows less. If 4 students are less in a row, there would be four more rows. Find the number of
students in the class.
Ans : Let number of students in a row be x and number of rows be y.
⇒ Total number of students = x . y
From condition 1 : (x + 4) (y – 2) = xy
⇒ xy – 2x + 4y – 8 = xy – 2x + 4y = 8 ...(i)
From condition 2 : (x – 4) (y + 4) = xy xy + 4x – 4y – 16 = xy
⇒ 4x – 4y = 16 ...(ii)
Adding (i) and (ii), we get 2x = 24 ⇒ x = 12
Substituting in (i), we get y = 8.
∴ Total number of students = xy = 12 × 8 = 96.

30. A circle is inscribed in a ∆ABC having sides 16 cm, 20 cm and 24 cm as shown in figure. Find AD,
BE and CF.

Ans: Since, tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
∴ AD = AF = x (say)
BD = BE = y (say)
CE = CF = z (say)
According to the question,
AB = x + y = 24 cm ...(i)
BC = y + z = 16 cm ...(ii)
AC = x + z = 20 cm ...(iii)
Subtracting (iii) from (i), we get
y – z = 4 ...(iv)
Adding (ii) and (iv), we get
2y = 20 ⇒ y = 10 cm
Substituting the value of y in (i) and (ii), we get
x = 14 cm, z = 6 cm
Hence, AD = 14 cm, BE = 10 cm and CF = 6 cm.
OR

Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 7 -

Ans: Join OC. Since, the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal.
∴ AP = AC
In Δ PAO and Δ AOC, we have:
AO = AO [Common]
OP = OC [Radii of the same circle]
AP = AC
⇒ Δ PAO ≅ Δ AOC [SSS Congruency]
∴ ∠PAO = ∠CAO = ∠1
∠PAC = 2 ∠1
...(1)
Similarly ∠CBQ = 2 ∠2
...(2)

Again, we know that sum of internal angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°.
∴ ∠PAC + ∠CBQ = 180°
⇒ 2 ∠1 + 2 ∠2 = 180° [From (1) and (2)]
⇒ ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°/2 = 90°
...(3)
Also ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠AOB = 180° [Sum of angles of a triangle]
⇒ 90° + ∠AOB = 180°
⇒ ∠AOB = 180° − 90° ⇒ ∠AOB = 90°.
31. Two dice are thrown at the same time. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers
appearing on the top of the dice is
(i) at least 9?
(ii) 7?
(iii) less than or equal to 6?
Ans: (i) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers is at least 9 = 10
∴ Required Probability = 10/36 = 5/18
(ii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers 7 = 6
∴ Required Probability = 6/36 = 1/6
(iii) Number of outcomes with sum of the numbers less than or equal to 6 = 36
∴ Required Probability = 15/36 = 5/12

produce 1800 cars in 4th year and 2600 cars in 8th year. Assuming that the production increases
uniformly by a fixed number every year.

Based on the above information answer the following questions.
(i) Find the production in the 1st year.
(1)
(ii) Find the production in the 12th year.
(1)
(iii) Find the total production in first 10 years. (2)
OR
(iii) In how many years will the total production reach 31200 cars?

(2)

Ans: (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, the number of Cars
manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . .,years will form an AP.
So, a + 3d = 1800 & a + 7d = 2600
So d = 200 & a = 1200
(ii) a12 = a + 11d ⇒ a30 = 1200 + 11 × 200
⇒ a12 = 3400

⇒ n2 + 24n – 13n – 312 = 0
⇒ (n +24)(n – 13) = 0
⇒ n = 13 or – 24.
As n can’t be negative. So n = 13

A lighthouse is a tall tower with light near the top. These are often built on islands, coasts or on cliffs.
Lighthouses on water surface act as a navigational aid to the mariners and send warning to boats and ships
for dangers. Initially wood, coal would be used as illuminators. Gradually it was replaced by candles,
lanterns, electric lights. Nowadays they are run by machines and remote monitoring. Prongs Reef lighthouse
of Mumbai was constructed in 1874-75. It is approximately 40 meters high and its beam can be seen at a
distance of 30 kilometres. A ship and a boat are coming towards the lighthouse from opposite directions.
Angles of depression of flash light from the lighthouse to the boat and the ship are 300 and 600 respectively.

26. A man wished to give Rs. 12 to each person and found that he fell short of Rs. 6 when he wanted to
give to all the persons present. He, therefore, distributed Rs. 9 to each person and found that Rs. 9
were left over. How much money did he have and how many persons were there?
Ans. Let, number of persons = x
Prepared by: M. S. KumarSwamy, TGT(Maths)

Page - 5-

Money share per person = y
Therefore, total money = Rs. xy
According to the question, 12 × x = xy + 6 ⇒ 12x – 6 = xy ...(i)
and 9x = xy – 9
9x + 9 = xy ...(ii)
Equating (i) and (ii), we get
12x – 6 = 9x + 9 ⇒ 3x = 15
Put the value of x in equation (i). Then
12 × 5 – 6 = x × y ⇒ xy = 54
So, he have Rs. 54 and there were 5 persons.
OR
A father’s age is three times the sum of the ages of his children. After 5 years, his age will be two
times the sum of their ages. Find the present age of the father.
Ans. Let the sum of the ages of two children be 'x' years and father's age be 'y' years.
According to the given condition: y = 3x
or y – 3x = 0 ...(i)
After 5 years, Father’s age = (y + 5) years
Sum of the ages of children = (x + 5 + 5) years.
Then, y + 5 = 2(x + 10)
or y – 2x – 15 = 0 ...(ii)
On subtracting equation (i) from equation (ii), we get x = 15
If we put the value of x in equation (i), we get
y – 3 × 15 = 0
⇒ y = 45
Hence, the present age of the father is 45 years.

29. Given that √3 is irrational, prove that 5 + 2√3 is irrational.
Ans: Let us assume 5 + 2√3 is rational, then it must be in the form of p/q where p and q are coprime integers and q ≠0
i.e 5 + 2√3 = p/q
p  5q
So √3 =
…(i)
2q
Since p, q, 5 and 2 are integers and q ≠ 0,
RHS of equation (i) is rational.
But LHS of (i) is √3 which is irrational. This is not possible.
This contradiction has arisen due to our wrong assumption that 5 + 2√3 is rational
So, 5 + 2√3 is irrational.
30. Cards numbered 1 to 30 are put in a bag. A card is drawn at random from this bag. Find the
probability that the number on the drawn card is
(i) not divisible by 3.
(ii) a prime number greater than 7.
(iii) not a perfect square number.
Ans : Total possible outcomes of drawing a card from a bag out of 30 cards = 30.
(i) Favourable outcomes for a card numbered not divisible by 3 = 20 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13,
14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28 and 29).
Probability of drawing a card numbered not divisible by 3 = 20/30 = 2/3
(ii) Favourable outcomes for a prime numbered card greater than 7 = 6 (i.e. 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and
29)
Probability of drawing a prime number card, greater than 7 = 6/30 = 1/5
(iii) Favourable outcomes for not a perfect square numbered card = 25 (leaving 1, 4, 9, 16 and 25)
Probability of drawing a card which is not a perfect square = 25/30 = 5/6

∠PBA = ∠PAB [Angles opposite to the equal sides of a triangle are equal.]
∠APB+ ∠PBA +∠PAB= 180° [Sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°]
x° + ∠PAB +∠PAB = 180° (∠PBA = ∠PAB)
⇒ x° + 2∠PAB = 180°
⇒ ∠PAB =½(180° - x°)
⇒ ∠PAB =90° - x°/2
⇒ ∠OAB +∠PAB=90°
⇒ ∠OAB =90° - (90° - x°/2)
⇒ ∠OAB = x°/2 ⇒ ∠OAB = ∠APB /2 ⇒ ∠APB = 2∠OAB

In ΔOAP and ΔOAS
AP=AS ( Tangents from to same point A)
PO=OS ( Radii of the same circle)
OA=OA ( Common side)
so, ΔOAP=ΔOAS (SSS congruence criterion)
∴ ∠POA=∠AOS (CPCT) ⇒ ∠1=∠8
Similarly, ∠2=∠3, ∠4=∠5 and ∠6=∠7
∠1+∠2 +∠3+∠4+∠5+∠6+∠7+∠8 = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1 +∠8) +(∠2 +∠3) + (∠4 +∠5) + (∠6 +∠7) = 360⁰
⇒ 2(∠1) + 2(∠2) + 2(∠5) + 2(∠6) = 360⁰
⇒ (∠1) + (∠2) + (∠5) + (∠6) = 180⁰

Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of the base of
the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is
EH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm
So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy
= (3.14 × 22 × 4 – 25.12) cm3
= 25.12 cm3
Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3.

36. India is competitive manufacturing location due to the low cost of manpower and strong technical
and engineering capabilities contributing to higher quality production runs. The production of TV
sets in a factory increases uniformly by a fixed number every year. It produced 16000 sets in 6th
year and 22600 in 9th year.

On the basis of the above information, answer any four of the following questions:
(i) What is the production of first year?
(1)
(ii) What is the production of 8th year?
(1)
(iii) What is the production during first three years?
(2)
OR
(iii) In which year, the production is 29,200?
(2)
Ans: (i) Rs 5000
(ii) Production during 8th year is (a + 7d) = 5000 + 7(2200) = 20400
(iii) Production during first 3 year = 5000 + 7200 + 9400 = 21600
OR
(iii)an = a + (n – 1)d
⇒ 29200 = 5000 + (n – 1)2200
⇒ (n – 1)2200 = 29200 – 5000 = 24200
⇒ n – 1 = 24200/2200 = 11
⇒ n = 11 + 1 = 12

⇒ DC = 8 and BD = 15
From Pythagoras theorem,
BC2 = BD2 + DC2
⇒ BC2 = 152 + 82
⇒ BC = 225 + 64 = 289
⇒ BC = 17
⇒ sin α = BD/BC = 15/17

•

Euclid’s Division Lemma : Given two positive integers a and b, there exist unique
integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b.
Euclid’s Division Algorithm to obtain the HCF of two positive integers, say c and d,
c > d.
Step 1 : Apply Euclid’s division lemma to c and d, to find whole numbers q and r,
such that c = dq + r, 0 ≤ r < d.
Step 2 : If r = 0, d is the HCF of c and d. If r ≠ 0, apply the division lemma to
d and r.
Step 3 : Continue the process till the remainder is zero. The divisor at this stage
will be the required HCF.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic : Every composite number can be expressed
as a product of primes, and this expression (factorisation) is unique, apart from the
order in which the prime factors occur.
Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where a is a positive
integer.

•

The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational.

•

For any two positive integers a and b, HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b.

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning
Sample Question 1: The values of the remainder r, when a positive integer a is
divided by 3 are 0 and 1 only. Justify your answer.
Solution : No.

03/05/18

4

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

According to Euclid’s division lemma,
a = 3q + r, where 0 ≤ r < 3
and r is an integer. Therefore, the values of r can be 0, 1 or 2.
Sample Question 2: Can the number 6n, n being a natural number, end with the
digit 5? Give reasons.
Solution : No, because 6n = (2 × 3)n = 2n × 3n, so the only primes in the factorisation
of 6n are 2 and 3, and not 5.
Hence, it cannot end with the digit 5.

EXERCISE 1.2
1. Write whether every positive integer can be of the form 4q + 2, where q is an
integer. Justify your answer.
2. “The product of two consecutive positive integers is divisible by 2”. Is this statement

3. “The product of three consecutive positive integers is divisible by 6”. Is this statement
true or false”? Justify your answer.
4. Write whether the square of any positive integer can be of the form 3m + 2, where
m is a natural number. Justify your answer.
5. A positive integer is of the form 3q + 1, q being a natural number. Can you write its
square in any form other than 3m + 1, i.e., 3m or 3m + 2 for some integer m? Justify
your answer.
6. The numbers 525 and 3000 are both divisible only by 3, 5, 15, 25 and 75. What is
HCF (525, 3000)? Justify your answer.
7. Explain why 3 × 5 × 7 + 7 is a composite number.
8. Can two numbers have 18 as their HCF and 380 as their LCM? Give reasons.

(D) Short Answer Questions
Sample Question 1: Using Euclid’s division algorithm, find which of the following
pairs of numbers are co-prime:
(i) 231, 396

(ii) 847, 2160

Solution : Let us find the HCF of each pair of numbers.
(i)

396 = 231 × 1 + 165
231 = 165 × 1 + 66
165 = 66 × 2 + 33
66 = 33 × 2 + 0

Therefore, HCF = 33. Hence, numbers are not co-prime.
(ii)

2160 = 847 × 2 + 466
847 = 466 × 1 + 381
466 = 381 × 1 + 85
381 = 85 × 4 + 41
85 = 41 × 2 + 3
41 = 3 × 13 + 2
3

= 2×1 + 1

2

= 1×2 + 0

Therefore, the HCF = 1. Hence, the numbers are co-prime.
Sample Question 2: Show that the square of an odd positive integer is of the form
8m + 1, for some whole number m.
Solution: Any positive odd integer is of the form 2q + 1, where q is a whole number.
Therefore, (2q + 1)2 = 4q2 + 4q + 1 = 4q (q + 1) + 1,

(1)

q (q + 1) is either 0 or even. So, it is 2m, where m is a whole number.
Therefore, (2q + 1)2 = 4.2 m + 1 = 8 m + 1.
Sample Question 3: Prove that

2 + 3 is irrational.

Solution : Let us suppose that

2 + 3 is rational. Let

[From (1)]

2 + 3 = a , where a is

rational.

03/05/18

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

Therefore,

2 = a− 3

Squaring on both sides, we get
2 = a2 + 3 – 2a 3
Therefore,

3=

a 2 +1
, which is a contradiction as the right hand side is a rational
2a

3 is irrational. Hence,

2 + 3 is irrational.

EXERCISE 1.3
1. Show that the square of any positive integer is either of the form 4q or 4q + 1 for
some integer q.
2. Show that cube of any positive integer is of the form 4m, 4m + 1 or 4m + 3, for
some integer m.
3. Show that the square of any positive integer cannot be of the form 5q + 2 or
5q + 3 for any integer q.
4. Show that the square of any positive integer cannot be of the form 6m + 2 or
6m + 5 for any integer m.
5. Show that the square of any odd integer is of the form 4q + 1, for some integer q.
6. If n is an odd integer, then show that n2 – 1 is divisible by 8.
7. Prove that if x and y are both odd positive integers, then x2 + y2 is even but not
divisible by 4.
8. Use Euclid’s division algorithm to find the HCF of 441, 567, 693.
9. Using Euclid’s division algorithm, find the largest number that divides 1251, 9377
and 15628 leaving remainders 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
10. Prove that

3 + 5 is irrational.

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : Show that the square of an odd positive integer can be of the
form 6q + 1 or 6q + 3 for some integer q.
Solution : We know that any positive integer can be of the form 6m, 6m + 1, 6m + 2,
6m + 3, 6m + 4 or 6m + 5, for some integer m.
Thus, an odd positive integer can be of the form 6m + 1, 6m + 3, or 6m + 5
Thus we have:
(6 m +1)2 = 36 m2 + 12 m + 1 = 6 (6 m2 + 2 m) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer
(6 m + 3)2 = 36 m2 + 36 m + 9 = 6 (6 m2 + 6 m + 1) + 3 = 6 q + 3, q is an integer
(6 m + 5)2 = 36 m2 + 60 m + 25 = 6 (6 m2 + 10 m + 4) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer.
Thus, the square of an odd positive integer can be of the form 6q + 1 or 6q + 3.

EXERCISE 1.4
1. Show that the cube of a positive integer of the form 6q + r, q is an integer and
r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is also of the form 6m + r.

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

Solution : Let p(x) = x3 + 2x2 + kx + 3
Then, p(3) = 33 + 2 × 32 + 3k + 3 = 21
i.e.,

i.e.,
k = –9
Hence, the given polynomial will become x3 + 2x2 – 9x + 3.

So,

x3 + 2x2 – 9x + 3 = (x2 + 5x + 6) (x – 3) + 21

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
(A) Main Concepts and Results

•

Two linear equations in the same two variables are said to form a pair of linear
equations in two variables.

•

The most general form of a pair of linear equations is
a1x + b1 y + c1 = 0
a2x + b2 y + c2 = 0,
where a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2 are real numbers, such that a12 + b12 ≠ 0, a22 + b22 ≠ 0 .

•

A pair of linear equations is consistent if it has a solution – either a unique or
infinitely many.
In case of infinitely many solutions, the pair of linear equations is also said to be
dependent. Thus, in this case, the pair of linear equations is dependent and consistent.

• A pair of linear equations is inconsistent, if it has no solution.

Let a pair of linear equations in two variables be a1x + b 1y + c 1 = 0 and

i.e.,

4p + 32q = 10p + 35q and 8q – 4p + 4 = 4p + 14q

Substituting the value of q obtained from Equation(1) in Equation(2), we get

So, for p = –1, q = 2, the given pair of linear equations will have infinitely many

21x + 47y = 110
47x + 21y = 162
Solution: We have
21x + 47y = 110
47x + 21y = 162

(1)
(2)

Multiplying Equation (1) by 47 and Equation (2) by 21, we get
987x + 2209 y = 5170

(3)

987x + 441y = 3402

(4)

Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3), we get
1768y = 1768
or
y=1
Substituting the value of y in Equation (1), we get
21x + 47 = 110
or
21x = 63
or
x=3
So,
x = 3, y = 1
Alternative Solution: We have

area of the figure.
Solution :
We know that the graph of x = –2 is a line parallel to y-axis at a distance of 2 units
to the left of it.
So, the line l is the graph of x = –2 [see Fig. 3.3]

The graph of y = 3 is a line parallel to the x-axis at a distance of 3 units above it.
So, the line m is the graph of y = 3.
The figure enclosed by the lines x = –2, y = 3, the x-axis and the y-axis is OABC,
which is a rectangle. (Why?)
A is a point on the y-axis at a distance of 3 units above the x-axis. So, the coordinates
of A are (0, 3);
C is a point on the x-axis at a distance of 2 units to the left of y-axis. So, the coordinates
of C are (–2, 0)
B is the solution of the pair of equations x = –2 and y = 3. So, the coordinates of B are
(–2, 3)
So, the vertices of the rectangle OABC are O (0, 0), A (0, 3), B (–2, 3), C (–2, 0)
The length and breadth of this rectangle are 2 units and 3 units, respectively.
As the area of a rectangle = length × breadth,
the area of rectangle OABC = 2 × 3 = 6 sq. units.

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

5x – y = 5, x + 2y = 1 and 6x + y = 17.
Solution:
The vertex of a triangle is the common solution of the two equations forming its two
sides. So, solving the given equations pairwise will give the vertices of the triangle.
From the given equations, we will have the following three pairs of equations:
5x – y = 5

and

x + 2y = 1

x + 2y = 1

and

6x + y = 17

5x – y = 5

and

6x + y = 17

Solving the pair of equations
5x – y = 5
x + 2y = 1
we get, x = 1, y = 0
So, one vertex of the triangle is (1, 0)
Solving the second pair of equations
x + 2y = 1
6x + y = 17
we get x = 3, y = –1
So, another vertex of the triangle is (3, –1)
Solving the third pair of equations
5x – y = 5
6x + y = 17,
we get x = 2, y = 5.
So, the third vertex of the triangle is (2, 5). So, the three vertices of the triangle are
(1, 0), (3, –1) and (2, 5).
Sample Question 3 : Jamila sold a table and a chair for Rs 1050, thereby making a

Solution : Let the cost price of the table be Rs x and the cost price of the chair
be Rs y.

On adding and subtracting these equations, we get
235x + 235y = 211500
and

15x – 15y = 1500

i.e.,

x+y = 900

and

x – y = 100

(4)

Solving Equations (3) and (4), we get
x = 500, y = 400
So, the cost price of the table is Rs 500 and the cost price of the chair is Rs 400.

Let the time taken by the pipe of larger diameter to fill the pool be x hours and that
taken by the pipe of smaller diameter pipe alone be y hours.
In x hours, the pipe of larger diameter fills the pool.

Finding the roots of a quadratic equation by the method of completing the
square : By adding and subtracting a suitable constant, we club the x2 and x terms
in the quadratic equation so that they become a complete square, and solve for x.

Sample Question 2 : Had Ajita scored 10 more marks in her mathematics test out of
30 marks, 9 times these marks would have been the square of her actual marks. How
many marks did she get in the test?
Solution :

Let her actual marks be x

Therefore,

9 (x +10) = x2

i.e.,

x2 – 9x – 90 = 0

i.e.,

x2 – 15x + 6x – 90 = 0

i.e.,

x(x – 15) + 6(x –15) = 0

i.e.,

(x + 6) (x –15) = 0

Therefore,

x=–6

or

x =15

Since x is the marks obtained, x ≠ – 6. Therefore, x = 15.
So, Ajita got 15 marks in her mathematics test.
Sample Question 3 : A train travels at a certain average speed for a distance of

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

i.e.,

21 (x + 6) + 24x = x (x + 6)

i.e.,

21x + 126 + 24x = x2 + 6x

i.e.,

x2 – 39x – 126 = 0

i.e.,

(x + 3) (x – 42) = 0

i.e.,

x = – 3 or x = 42

Since x is the average speed of the train, x cannot be negative.
Therefore, x = 42.
So, the original average speed of the train is 42 km/h.

ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS

(A) Main Concepts and Results

•

An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is
obtained by adding a fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term
a. The fixed number d is called its common difference.
The general form of an AP is a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d,...

•

In the list of numbers a1, a2, a3,... if the differences a2 – a1, a3 – a2, a4 – a3,...
give the same value, i.e., if ak + 1 – ak is the same for different values of k, then
the given list of numbers is an AP.

•

The nth term an (or the general term) of an AP is an = a + (n – 1) d, where a is
the first term and d is the common difference. Note that a1 = a.

•

The sum Sn of the first n terms of an AP is given by
Sn =

n
[2a + (n – 1) d]
2

If l is the last term of an AP of n terms, then the sum of all the terms can also be
given by
Sn =

n
[a + l]
2

Sometimes Sn is also denoted by S.

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning
Sample Question 1: In the AP: 10, 5, 0, –5, ... the common difference d is equal to 5.
Justify whether the above statement is true or false.
Solution :
a2 – a1 = 5 – 10 = – 5
a3 – a2 = 0 – 5 = – 5
a4 – a3 = –5 – 0 = – 5
Although the given list of numbers forms an AP, it is with d = –5 and not with d = 5
So, the given statement is false.
Sample Question 2 : Divya deposited Rs 1000 at compound interest at the rate of
10% per annum. The amounts at the end of first year, second year, third year, ..., form
an AP. Justify your answer.
Solution :

Amount at the end of the 1st year = Rs 1100
Amount at the end of the 2nd year = Rs 1210
Amount at the end of 3rd year = Rs 1331 and so on.

So, the amount (in Rs) at the end of 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, ... are
1100, 1210, 1331, ...
Here,

a2 – a1 = 110
a3 – a2 = 121

As,

a2 – a1 ≠ a3 – a2, it does not form an AP.

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

Sample Question 3: The nth term of an AP cannot be n2 + 1. Justify your answer.
Solution :
Here, an = n2 + 1
So,

a1 = 12 + 1= 2
a2 = 22 + 1 = 5
a3 = 32 + 1= 10


List of numbers becomes 2, 5, 10, ...

Here, 5 – 2 ≠ 10–5, so it does not form an AP.
Alternative Solution 1:
We know that in an AP, d = an – an –1
Here, an = n2 + 1
So,

an – an –1 = ( n2 + 1) – (n – 1)2 + 1

= 2n – 1
As an – an –1 depends upon n, d is not a fixed number.
So, an = n 2 + 1 cannot be the nth term of an AP.
Alternative Solution 2:
We know that in an AP
an = a + ( n –1) d . We observe that an is a linear polynomial in n.
Here, an = n 2 + 1 is not a linear polynomial in n. So, it cannot be the nth term of an AP.

(iii) 1+n+n2

(D) Short Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : If the numbers n – 2, 4n – 1 and 5n + 2 are in AP, find the
value of n.
Solution :
As n – 2, 4n – 1, 5n + 2 are in AP,
so

(4n – 1) – (n – 2) = (5n + 2) – (4n – 1)

i.e,

3n + 1 = n + 3

i.e,

n=1

Sample Question 2 : Find the value of the middle most term (s) of the AP :
–11, –7, –3,..., 49.
Solution :
Here, a = –11, d = –7 – (–11) = 4, an = 49
We have an = a + (n – 1) d
So,

49 = –11 + (n – 1) × 4

i.e.,

60 = (n – 1) × 4

i.e.,

n = 16

As n is an even number, there will be two middle terms which are

a8 = a + 7d = –11 + 7 × 4 = 17
a9 = a + 8d = –11 + 8 × 4 = 21
So, the values of the two middle most terms are 17 and 21, respectively.
Sample Question 3: The sum of the first three terms of an AP is 33. If the product of
the first and the third term exceeds the second term by 29, find the AP.
Solution : Let the three terms in AP be
a – d, a, a + d.
So,

a – d + a + a + d = 33

or

a = 11

Also,

(a – d) (a + d) = a + 29

i.e.,

a 2 – d 2 = a + 29

i.e.,

121 – d 2 = 11 + 29

i.e.,

d 2 = 81

i.e.,

d=±9

So there will be two APs and they are : 2, 11, 20, ...
and 20, 11, 2, ...

Sample Question 1: The sum of four consecutive numbers in an AP is 32 and the
ratio of the product of the first and the last terms to the product of the two middle terms
is 7 : 15. Find the numbers.
Solution: Let the four consecutive numbers in AP be
a –3d, a – d, a + d, a + 3d.

03/05/18

ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS

So,

55

a –3d + a – d + a + d + a + 3d = 32
or

4a = 32

or

a=8

Also,

(a – 3d )( a + 3d ) = 7
( a – d )( a + d ) 15

or,

a 2 – 9d 2 7
=
a 2 – d 2 15

or,

15 a2 – 135 d 2 = 7a2 – 7 d 2

or,

8 a2 – 128 d 2 = 0

or,

d2 =

d=±2

Solution :
Here, 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., x form an AP with a = 1, d = 3, an = x
We have, an = a + (n – 1)d
So,

x = 1 + (n – 1) × 3 = 3n – 2

As n cannot be negative, so n = 14
Therefore, x = 3n – 2 = 3 × 14 – 2 = 40.
Alternative solution:
Here, 1, 4, 7, 10, ... x form an AP with a = 1, d = 3, S = 287
We have, S=

So, 287 =

or, 574 = n (3n – 1)

x + (x + 5) = (25)

or

x + x + 10 x + 25 = 625

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : The mid-points D, E, F of the sides of a triangle ABC are (3, 4),
(8, 9) and (6, 7). Find the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
Solution : Since D and F are the mid-points of AB and AC, respectively, by
mid-point theorem, we can prove that DFEB is a parallelogram. Let the coordinates
of B be (x, y).

Refer to Sample Question 4 of Section (D) to get
x=3+8–6=5
y=4+9–7=6
Therefore, B (5, 6) is one of the vertices of the triangle.
Similarly DFCE and DAFE are also parallelograms, and the coordinates of A are
(3 + 6 – 8, 4 + 7 – 9) = (1, 2). Coordinates of C are (8 + 6 – 3, 9 + 7 – 4) = (11, 12).
Thus, the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle are A (1, 2), B (5,6) and C ( 11, 12).

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

In Fig. 8.2, B is moved closer to C along BC. It is observed that
(i) θ increases (as θ1 > θ, θ2 > θ1, ...) and
(ii) BC decreases (B1C < BC, B2C < B1C, ...)
Thus the perpendicular AC remains fixed and the base BC decreases. Hence tanθ
increases as θ increases.
Sample Question 3 : tanθ increases faster than sinθ as θ increases.
Solution : True
We know that sinθ increases as θ increases but cosθ decreases as θ increases.
We have tan θ =

sin θ
cos θ

Now as θ increases, sinθ increases but cosθ decreases. Therefore, in case of tanθ, the
numerator increases and the denominator decreases. But in case of sinθ which can be

sin θ

AB of the right triangle ABC at D, E and F
respectively, where BC = a, CA = b and
AB = c (see Fig. 9.12). Then AE = AF and
BD = BF. Also CE = CD = r.
i.e.,

b – r = AF, a – r = BF

Sample Question 1 : A chord of a circle of radius 20 cm subtends an angle of 90°
at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding major segment of the circle.
(Use π = 3.14).

Solution : Let A B be the chord of a circle of radius 10 cm, with O as the centre of the
circle (see Fig. 11.14).

Here, ∠A O B = 90° and we have to find the area of the major segment (which is
shaded). As ∠AOB= 90°, therefore angle of the major sector = 360° – 90° = 270°
So, area of the major sector =

Sample Question 5 : Three cubes of a metal whose edges are in the ratio 3:4:5 are
melted and converted into a single cube whose diagonal is 12 3 cm. Find the edges of
the three cubes.
Solution : Let the edges of three cubes (in cm) be 3x, 4x and 5x, respectively.
Volume of the cubes after melting is = (3x)3 + (4x)3 + (5x)3 = 216x3 cm3
Let a be the side of new cube so formed after melting. Therefore, a3 = 216x3
So, a = 6x, Diagonal =

a2 + a2 + a 2 = a 3

But it is given that diagonal of the new cube is 12 3 cm. Therefore, a 3 =12 3 ,
i.e., a = 12.

(b) Mode of Grouped Data
(i)

In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode
by looking at the frequencies. To find the mode of grouped data, locate the
class with the maximum frequency. This class is known as the modal class.
The mode of the data is a value inside the modal class.

Mode of the grouped data can be calculated by using the formula
f1 − f 0
Mode = l + 2 f − f − f × h ,

where l is the lower limit of the modal class, h is the size of the class,
f1 is frequency of the modal class and f0 and f2 are the frequencies of the
classes preceding and succeeding the modal class, respectively.

(c) Median of Grouped Data
(i)

Cumulative frequency table – the less than type and the more than type of
the grouped frequency distribution.

(ii)

If n is the total number of observations, locate the class whose cumulative
frequency is greater than (and nearest to)

n
. This class is called the median

Probability
• Random experiment, outcome of an experiment, event, elementary events.
• Equally likely outcomes.
• The theoretical (or classical) probability of an event E [denoted by P(E)] is
given by
P(E) =

Number of outcomes favourable to E
Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment

•

where the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.
The probability of an event can be any number between 0 and 1. It can also
be 0 or 1 in some special cases.
The sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning
Sample Question 1: The mean of ungrouped data and the mean calculated when the
same data is grouped are always the same. Do you agree with this statement? Give
reason for your answer.
Solution : The statement is not true. The reason is that when we calculated mean of
a grouped data, it is assumed that frequency of each class is centred at the mid-point of
the class. Because of this, two values of the mean, namely, those from ungrouped and
grouped data are rarely the same.
Sample Question 2 : Is it correct to say that an ogive is a graphical representation of
a frequency distribution? Give reason.
Solution : Graphical representation of a frequency distribution may not be an ogive. It
may be a histogram. An ogive is a graphical representation of cumulative frequency
distribution.
Sample Question 3 : In any situation that has only two possible outcomes, each
outcome will have probability

1
. True or false? Why?
2

Solution : False, because the probability of each outcome will be

1
only when the
2

two outcomes are equally likely otherwise not.

A Hill Station: In the last summer, I enjoyed a tour to a hill station at
Shimla. I was accompanied by my five friends and enjoyed the natural
beauties of mountains, rivers, streams, forests etc. The beginning of
the tour was the most adventurous itself! How amazingly my group
win the bet! Actually, the story is that my two friends along with me
preferred train to go to Shimla, but other three were forcing for a car
or a bus. At last the consensus was reached and we were divided
ourselves in two groups of 3 each and started for Shimla at the same
time. It was decided that the group who reach the destination first,

would be declared as the winner, and runner up the group have to bear
the expenses of the tour. I named my group, ‘Group A’ while the
second group was named as ‘Group B’. Luckily we reached Shimla 1
hour before the Group-B and enjoyed the trip for absolutely FREE!!
How thrilling it was the tour!
