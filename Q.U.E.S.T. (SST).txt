Nationalism in India 
Q.1. Explain:
(a) Why is the growth of nationalism in the colonies linked to an anti-colonial movement ?
(b) How did the First World War help in the growth of the National Movement in India?	
(c) Why were Indians outraged by the Rowlatt Act ?
(d) Why did Gandhiji decide to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement?
Ans.
(a) The growth of Modern nationalism in the colonies is linked to an anti-colonial movement due to the factors as mentioned below :
People found unity through their struggle against colonialism, creating a shared bond despite different experiences and ideas of freedom. Mahatma Gandhi's Congress tried to unite these diverse groups into one movement. Despite differences and conflicts, various groups joined the Indian National Congress and participated in anti-colonial movements against the British.
b) The First World War spurred the growth of the National Movement in India by creating new economic and political challenges:
Increased defense expenditure
War loans and higher taxes
Raised custom duties
Introduction of income tax
Rising prices causing hardship
Forced recruitment causing rural discontent
Crop failures in 1918-19 and 1920-21 leading to food shortages
An influenza epidemic, with 12-13 million deaths from famines and epidemics (Census of 1921)
c) Indians were outraged by the Rowlatt Act (1919) for these reasons:
They hoped for better conditions after the war, but the government passed the Rowlatt Act instead.
The Act passed despite united opposition from Indian members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
It gave the government extensive powers to repress political activities and detain political prisoners without trial for two years.
This suspended two key justice principles: trial by jury and habeas corpus (protection against illegal imprisonment).
d) Gandhiji decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement for these reasons:
The movement was becoming violent in many places.
He believed Satyagrahis needed proper training for mass struggles.
In Chauri-Chaura (UP), 22 policemen were killed after firing on a political procession.
There were also disturbances in Madras and Calcutta.
Q.2. What is meant by the idea of Satyagraha?


Ans.Satyagraha is soul-force based on truth, emphasizing non-violence and the search for truth. Satyagraha suggests that if the cause is true and the struggle is against injustice, physical force is unnecessary. A satyagraha can win through non-violence without seeking vengeance or being aggressive. It suggests that a true cause can be won through non-violence without seeking vengeance or being aggressive. 

Q.3. Write a newspaper report on :
(a) The Jallianwala Bagh massacre
(b) The Simon Commission


Ans. (a) The Jallianwala Bagh massacre: On April 13, 1919, a public meeting was held at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, to protest the Rowlatt Act. Thousands gathered peacefully. General Dyer arrived with troops and armoured cars and, without warning, ordered firing on the unarmed crowd. Many Indians were killed. Dyer's aim was to instill fear and awe among the Satyagrahis. 
(b) ((i) The Indian members of the Central Legislative Assembly pointed out flaws in the Government of India Act of 1919. In response, the Simon Commission was appointed in 1927 to suggest further constitutional reforms. It consisted of seven members, all British, and was chaired by Sir John Simon.
(ii) The Simon Commission was boycotted by Indians because it had no Indian members and did not promise 'Swaraj' (self-rule), which was the main demand of the Indians. The Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and other parties decided to oppose it.
(iii) Indians organized hartals (strikes) nationwide and held black flag demonstrations with the slogan "Simon go back" when the Commission arrived in Bombay (Mumbai). Similar protests occurred wherever the Commission went.

The Making of a Global World
1. Give two examples of different types of global exchanges which took place before the seventeenth century, choosing one example from Asia and one from the Americas. 
Answer: Examples of the different types of global exchanges which took place before the seventeenth century: 
→ China, India and Southeast Asia exchanged textiles, spices and Chinese pottery in return for gold and silver from Europe. 
→ Gold and foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, tomatoes and chillies were first exported from the Americas to Europe. 
2. Explain how the global transfer of disease in the pre-modern world helped in the colonisation of the Americas. 
Answer The global transfer of disease in the pre-modern world helped colonize the Americas because native American Indians had no immunity to diseases brought by settlers. Europeans were immune to smallpox, but native Americans were not, as they had been isolated for millions of years. These diseases killed entire communities, making it easier for colonizers to dominate. While weapons and soldiers could be resisted, diseases could not.
3. Write a note to explain the effects of the following: 
(a) The British government's decision to abolish the Corn Laws. 
(b) The coming of rinderpest to Africa. 
(c) The death of men of working age in Europe because of the World War. 
(d) The Great Depression on the Indian economy. 
(e) The decision of MNCs to relocate production to Asian countries. 
Answer (a) The British government's decision to abolish the Corn Laws was the inflow of cheaper agricultural crops from America and Australia. Many English farmers left their profession and migrated to towns and cities. Some went overseas. This indirectly led to global agriculture and rapid urbanisation, a prerequisite of industrial growth. 
(b) The coming of rinderpest to Africa caused a loss of livelihood for countless Africans. Using this situation to their advantage, colonising nations conquered and subdued Africa by monopolising scarce cattle resources to force Africans into the labour market. 
(c) Most World War I victims were young working men, reducing the workforce in Europe and lowering household incomes. Women's roles increased, strengthening the feminist movement as they began working alongside men in all fields. Women and young people became more independent, leading to long-term social changes.
(d) The Great Depression greatly impacted India's agricultural sector, showing the country's growing integration with the global economy. As a British colony, India exported agricultural goods and imported manufactured ones. The fall in agricultural prices reduced farmers' incomes and exports. The government did not reduce taxes, leading many farmers and landlords to become more indebted to moneylenders and corrupt officials, causing significant rural unrest. 
e) The decision of MNCs to relocate production to Asian countries led to a stimulation of world trade and capital flows. This relocation was on account of low-cost structure and lower wages in Asian countries. It also benefitted the Asian nations because employment increased, and this resulted in quick economic transformation as well.
4. Give two examples from history to show the impact of technology on food availability. 
Answer Two examples from history to show the impact of technology on food availability were: 
→ Faster railways, lighter wagons and larger ships helped transport food more cheaply and quickly from production units to even faraway markets. 
→ Refrigerated ships helped transport perishable foods such as meat, butter and eggs over long distances. 
5. What is meant by the Bretton Woods Agreement? 
Answer The Bretton Woods Agreement was finalised in July 1944 at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA. It established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to preserve global economic stability and full employment in the industrial world. These institutions also dealt with external surpluses and deficits of member nations, and financed post-war reconstructions. 

The Age of Industrialisation
1. Explain the following: 
(a) Women workers in Britain attacked the Spinning Jenny. 
(b) In the seventeenth century merchants from towns in Europe began employing peasants and artisans within the villages. 
(c) The port of Surat declined by the end of the eighteenth century. 
(d) The East India Company appointed gomasthas to supervise weavers in India. 
Answer (a) Women workers in Britain attacked the Spinning Jenny because it speeded up the spinning process, and consequently, reduced labour demand. This caused a valid fear of unemployment among women working in the woollen industry. Till date, they had survived on hand spinning, but this was placed in peril by the new machine. 
(b) The trade and commerce guild controlled the market, raw materials, employees, and also production of goods in the towns. This created problems for merchants who wanted to increase production by employing more men. Therefore, they turned to peasants and artisans who lived in villages. 
(c) The port of Surat declined by the end of the eighteenth century on account of the growing power of European companies in trade with India. They secured many concessions from local courts as well as the monopoly rights to trade. This led to a decline of the old ports of Surat and Hoogly from where local merchants had operated. Exports slowed and local banks here went bankrupt. 
(d) The English East India Company appointed Gomasthas for: 
→ To eliminate the existence of traders and brokers and establish a direct control over the weavers. 
→ To eliminate weavers from dealing with other buyers by means of advances and control. In this manner, weavers who took loans and fees in advance were obligated to the British. 
2. Write True or False against each statement: 
(a) At the end of the nineteenth century, 80 per cent of the total workforce in Europe was employed in the technologically advanced industrial sector. 
b) The international market for fine textiles was dominated by India till the eighteenth century. 
c) The American Civil War resulted in the reduction of cotton exports from India. 
d) The introduction of the fly shuttle enabled handloom workers to improve their productivity.
Ans.
(a) False
(b) True
(c) False
(d) True
3. Explain what is meant by proto-industrialisation. 
Answer Proto-industrialisation is the phase of industrialisation that was not based on the factory system. Before the coming of factories, there was large-scale industrial production for an international market. This part of industrial history is known as protoindustrialisation. 

Print Culture and the Modern World 
1. Give reasons for the following:

(b) Martin Luther was in favour of print and spoke out in praise of it. 
(c) The Roman Catholic Church began keeping an Index of Prohibited books from the midsixteenth century. 
(d) Gandhi said the fight for Swaraj is a fight for liberty of speech, liberty of the press, and freedom of association. 
Answer (a) Woodblock printing originated in 6th-century China and reached Europe in 1295 via Marco Polo, who brought the technology back to Italy after his explorations.
(b) Martin Luther, through his protestant writings, challenged Roman Catholic Church practices in the 16th century. His 95 theses critiqued many church practices, leading to widespread reproduction and the Protestant Reformation. Luther's translation of the New Testament, facilitated by printing, sold 5,000 copies in days, prompting Luther to call printing "the ultimate gift of God."
(c) From the mid-16th century, the Roman Catholic Church faced dissent through numerous books interpreting theology differently. In response, the church compiled the Index of Prohibited Books to ban and monitor such works.
(d) Mahatma Gandhi viewed freedom of speech, press, and association as vital for public opinion and Swaraj (self-rule). He advocated these freedoms as essential vehicles for expressing and nurturing public sentiment.
 2. Write short notes to show what you know about: 
(a) The Gutenberg Press 
(b) Erasmus's idea of the printed book 
(c) The Vernacular Press Act 
Answer (a) Johannes Gutenberg developed the first printing press in the 1430s, based on earlier olive and wine presses. By 1448, he perfected the system using metal types for letters. His first printed book was the Bible, producing 180 copies in three years, a remarkable speed for the time.
(b) Erasmus, a Latin scholar and Catholic reformer, criticized the proliferation of printed books. He believed many books were foolish, ignorant, scandalous, and irreligious, devaluing valuable literature.
(c) The Vernacular Press Act, passed in 1878 and modeled on Irish laws, allowed the British government extensive censorship powers over vernacular newspapers in India. It authorized seizure of presses and machinery if seditious content was published, undermining freedom of expression.
3. What did the spread of print culture in nineteenth century India mean to: 
(a) Women 
(b) The poor
(c) Reformers 
Answer (a) In 19th century India, print culture empowered women by enabling education and reading. Despite societal opposition, women from liberal families pursued education in secrecy, leading some to write autobiographies like Rashasundari Devi's "Amar Jiban," published in 1876. This fostered a sense of self-reliance among Indian women.
(b) The spread of print culture in 19th century India benefited the poor by making books affordable and accessible. Low-priced publications increased readership, and public libraries emerged, providing knowledge to all. Inspired by social reformers, even factory workers like Kashibaba from Kanpur wrote and published books, such as "Chote aur Bade Ka Sawal."
(c) 19th century Indian reforms used print culture effectively to propagate reformist ideas and critique social issues. Vernacular and English-Hindi newspapers and books were crucial in challenging practices like widow immolation, child marriage, and Brahmanical orthodoxy. This dissemination of modern ideas across languages played a pivotal role in societal change.

(i) How do industries pollute the environment? 
(ii) Discuss the steps to be taken to minimise environmental degradation by industry? 
Answer 
(i) Industries are responsible for four types of pollution – air, water, land, and noise pollution. Following are the various reasons: 
→ Air pollution is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
→ Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and effluents discharged into rivers. 
→ Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants are drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. 
→ Wastes from nuclear plants cause cancer, birth defects and miscarriages. 
→ Dumping of wastes especially, glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts and other garbage render the soil useless. 
→ Noise pollution is caused due to industrial and construction activities, factory equipment, generators, electric saws, drills and other machineries. 
(ii) The steps to be taken to minimize environmental degradation by industry are: 
→ To control water pollution, industrial effluents need to be treated on all three levels (primary, secondary and tertiary); the use of water for processing should be minimised via reuse and recycling; rainwater can be harvested to meet water requirements, and ground water usage should be regulated by law. 
→ For the minimisation of air pollution, smoke stacks should be fitted to factories with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, scrubbers and inertial separators. Also, smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal. 
→ Noise pollution can be controlled by fitting generators with silencers, redesigning machinery to reduce noise, and using earplugs and earphones besides other noise absorbing material.

3. Point out one feature in the practice of federalism in India that is
similar to and one feature that is different from that of Belgium.
Answer 3: In India, the central government shares power with regional governments like Belgium. However, Belgium also has a community government, which India does not.


4. What is the main difference between a federal form of government
and a unitary one? Explain with an example.
Answer 4: In a federal government, power is shared between the central and constituent units, like in India, where the central and state governments share power. In a unitary government, one government holds all the power, as seen in Sri Lanka, where the national government has complete control.


5. State any two differences between the local government before and
after the Constitutional amendment in 1992.
Answer5:

Local Governments Before 1992:

Elections were state-controlled and irregular.
No independent powers or resources.
Local Governments After 1992:

Independent State Election Commission conducts regular elections.
State governments must share some powers and revenue with local bodies.


6. Fill in the blanks:
Since the United States is a ___________________ type of
federation, all the constituent States have equal powers and States
are ______________vis-à-vis the federal government. But India is a
_____________________ type of federation and some States have
more power than others. In India, the ____________ government
has more powers.
Answer6: Since the United States is a coming together type of federation, all the constituent States have equal powers and States are strong vis-à-vis the federal government. But India is a holding together type of federation and some States have more power than others. In India, the Central government has more powers.


7. Here are three reactions to the language policy followed in India.
Give an argument and an example to support any of these positions.
 Sangeeta: The policy of accommodation has strengthened
national unity.
 Arman: Language-based States have divided us by making
everyone conscious of their language.
 Harish: This policy has only helped to consolidate the
dominance of English over all other languages.
Answer 7: I agree with Sangeeta. Without the policy of accommodation and states based on language, India could have faced further partition. For instance, imposing Hindi as the national language might have led the South, particularly Tamil Nadu, to seek independence.

Outcomes of Democracy
1. How does democracy produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate government?
Answer.
The government can be held accountable by creating laws and policies that allow citizens to challenge them if they are not implemented or do not benefit citizens. When the government ignores citizen concerns, people can take action through protests, campaigns, and rallies to compel a response. A democratic government is legitimate because it is elected by and enjoys the trust of citizens.

2. What are the conditions under which democracies accommodate social diversities? Answer.
Social diversity can be respected by focusing on all communities in society, both majority and minority. In democracy, it's not about majority rule alone. Democratic countries strive for progress by working together, regardless of religious or linguistic differences. In a democracy, any person or group can become a majority based on support and participation.
3. Give arguments to support or oppose the following assertions:
Industrialised countries can afford democracy but the poor need dictatorship to become rich.
Democracy can't reduce inequality of incomes between different citizens.
The government in poor countries should spend less on poverty reduction, health, education and spend more on industries and infrastructure.
in a democracy, all citizens have one vote, which means that there is an absence of any domination and conflict.
Answer.
a. Industrialized countries can afford democracy, but economic development depends on resources, policies, and government openness to attract investment. Dictatorship does not guarantee wealth; for example, Nigeria has wealthy individuals despite not being a dictatorship.
b. Democracy does not directly reduce income inequality; it focuses on social and political equality through voting rights and fundamental freedoms. Income depends on individual abilities. Human resources, education, and health are crucial for a country's development, as judged by the Human Development Report.
c. For a country to develop, it must invest in education and health infrastructure, as human development, including education and health, determines a nation's progress.
d. Democracy provides equal voting rights, but it is not without conflicts, as seen in countries like India.The social divisions in the society are reflected in the form of riots, protests and strikes. Hence, no democracy can eliminate social divisions.
4. Identify the challenges to democracy in the following descriptions. Also, suggest policy/institutional mechanism to deepen democracy in the given situations:
a. Following a High Court directive, a temple in Orissa that had separate entry doors for Dalits and non-Dalits allowed entry for all from the same door.
Answer: The greatest challenge to democracy arises when discrimination based on caste, colour, or creed persists. Such practices are illegal under the Constitution and pose a threat to national peace. Legal action should be taken against those who engage in discrimination to preserve communal harmony in the country.
b. A large number of farmers are committing suicide in different states of India.
Answer: Many farmers in various Indian states are resorting to suicide due to economic inequality. They face challenges such as small land holdings and unpredictable weather, leading to crop losses and an inability to repay loans from moneylenders or banks. This situation has worsened over the years, pushing poor farmers to extreme measures. The government should support farmers by providing affordable fertilizers, seeds, and improved irrigation methods to alleviate their hardships.
c. Following allegation of killing of three civilians in Gandwara in a fake encounter by Jammu and Kashmir police, an enquiry has been ordered.
Answer: Allegations of killing three civilians in Gnadwara in a fake encounter by Jammu and Kashmir police raises questions on the police force of the state. The challenge here is to control the power of the police and other authoritative officials.

6. Do you think the classification of economic activities into primary, secondary, and tertiary is useful? Explain how.
Yes, the classification is useful because it helps in understanding the nature and contribution of each sector to the economy.
Primary Sector: Engages directly with natural resources, like agriculture, fishing, and mining. It forms the base of the economy.
Secondary Sector: Involves transforming raw materials from the primary sector into finished goods, like manufacturing and construction.
Tertiary Sector: Provides services that support both the primary and secondary sectors, including trade, banking, and communication.
This classification helps in analyzing the level of development in an economy by studying the contribution of each sector to employment and GDP .
7. For each of the sectors that we came across in this chapter, why should one focus on employment and GDP? Could there be other issues which should be examined? Discuss.
Focusing on employment and GDP is crucial because:
Primary Sector: Despite employing the majority, it contributes less to GDP, indicating underemployment.
Secondary Sector: Provides industrial growth but still faces challenges in job creation compared to production.
Tertiary Sector: Its contribution to GDP is high, but job creation is unequal, with a concentration of high-paying jobs in specific areas.
Other issues to examine include:
Workforce skill levels: To ensure that workers in all sectors can contribute productively.
Sustainability: Environmental impacts of each sector should be assessed to ensure long-term viability .
9. How is the tertiary sector different from other sectors? Illustrate with a few examples.
The tertiary sector differs because it provides services rather than producing goods. Unlike the primary and secondary sectors, which deal with natural resources and manufacturing, the tertiary sector supports economic activities through services.
Examples include:
Banking and insurance: Providing financial services to both individuals and businesses.
Education and healthcare: Offering essential social services.
Transport and communication: Facilitating trade and the exchange of goods between sectors .
10. What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example each from the urban and rural areas.
Disguised unemployment occurs when more people are employed than necessary, contributing little to productivity.
Rural Example: In agriculture, multiple family members may work on a small farm even though the work could be done by fewer people, as in Laxmi's family case.
Urban Example: Casual workers in cities may sell goods on the streets or engage in low-paying, part-time jobs because they cannot find regular employment .
11. Distinguish between open unemployment and disguised unemployment.
Open Unemployment: People are actively seeking jobs but unable to find any.
Disguised Unemployment: More workers are employed than needed, resulting in reduced productivity even though they appear to be working.
Open unemployment is visible, whereas disguised unemployment is harder to detect because workers are technically employed but are underutilized .
12. “Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian economy.” Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer.
I disagree. The tertiary sector has played a crucial role in the development of the Indian economy:
High GDP Contribution: It has grown significantly, surpassing the primary sector in GDP contribution.
Service Industry Growth: Industries like IT, banking, and communication have rapidly expanded, creating employment opportunities.
However, disparities exist in employment, with low-income workers in this sector struggling to find secure, well-paid jobs .
13. Service sector in India employs two different kinds of people. Who are these?
The service sector in India employs:
Highly Skilled Workers: Professionals like teachers, doctors, engineers, and IT experts.
Low-Income Workers: Individuals in jobs such as street vendors, transport workers, and repair personnel.
This wide range in employment highlights the sector's role in both high-end services and informal, low-paying jobs .
14. Workers are exploited in the unorganised sector. Do you agree with this view? Give reasons in support of your answer.
Answer: Yes, workers are often exploited in the unorganised sector. The reasons are:
Low wages: Workers in the unorganised sector usually receive less than the minimum wage. They often have no fixed income.
Job insecurity: Employment in this sector is not secure, and workers can be dismissed without notice, especially during economic downturns.
Lack of benefits: Workers in this sector are not entitled to benefits like health insurance, paid leave, or pension.
Poor working conditions: They often work in unsafe and unhealthy environments, lacking basic facilities.
15. How are the activities in the economy classified on the basis of employment conditions?
Answer: Based on employment conditions, economic activities are classified into two sectors:
Organised sector: This sector is regulated by the government. Workers enjoy job security, fixed working hours, and benefits like health insurance, provident fund, and pensions.
Unorganised sector: This sector consists of small and scattered units outside the control of the government. Workers lack job security, fixed working hours, and benefits. They often face exploitation.
16. Compare the employment conditions prevailing in the organised and unorganised sectors.
Answer:
Organised Sector:
Regulated by government laws.
Workers have secure jobs, fixed working hours, and benefits like provident fund and medical care.
They enjoy paid leave, retirement benefits, and safe working conditions.
Unorganised Sector:
Not regulated by government laws.
Workers face insecure jobs with low and irregular wages.
Lack of benefits like health care, paid leave, and pensions.
Working conditions are often unsafe and unhealthy.
17. Explain the objective of implementing the NREGA 2005.
Answer: The objective of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) 2005 is to provide 100 days of guaranteed wage employment every year to every household in rural areas. The aim is to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by ensuring employment to unskilled manual workers. If the government fails to provide employment, it must offer an unemployment allowance to the affected individuals.
18. Using examples from your area, compare and contrast the activities and functions of private and public sectors.
Answer:
Private Sector Example: In my area, a privately owned hospital offers high-end medical services at a cost, where the main goal is profit-making. While the services are efficient, they are expensive.
Public Sector Example: The government hospital, in contrast, provides affordable medical care, even free to certain sections of society. The focus here is public welfare, not profit.
The private sector is profit-driven and offers better quality services at a cost, while the public sector aims at providing essential services at affordable rates to all citizens.
20. Give a few examples of public sector activities and explain why the government has taken them up.
Answer: Some public sector activities include:
Railways: The government runs railways to ensure affordable and accessible transportation for all citizens across the country.
Electricity: Government-owned electricity companies provide power to rural and remote areas where private companies may not find it profitable to operate.
Water Supply: The government provides water supply to ensure that even the poorest households have access to clean drinking water.
The government has taken up these activities because they are essential for the overall development of the country. Providing them through the private sector might make them too expensive for the poor, leading to inequity.
21. Explain how the public sector contributes to the economic development of a nation.
Answer: The public sector, governed by the Indian government, includes essential services like water, electricity, and irrigation. Neglecting these services could harm the economy by halting national growth. Economic development relies on meeting people's basic needs. The government supports both small and large industries in this sector, creating employment opportunities.
22. The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues : wages, safety and health. Explain with examples.
Answer: The unorganised sector comprises small, scattered units largely outside government control, often disregarding regulations. Workers in this sector require protection:
Wages: Workers struggle with inconsistent incomes, needing fixed wages to ensure stable livelihoods and contribute effectively.
Safety: Job insecurity is prevalent, with workers easily dismissed after job completion without prospects for future employment.
Health: Lack of medical benefits leaves workers vulnerable; accidents on the job do not ensure employer responsibility, denying sick leave to daily wage laborers.
23. A study in Ahmedabad found that out of 15,00,000 workers in the city, 11,00,000 worked in the unorganised sector. The total income of the city in this year (1997-1998) was Rs 60,000 million. Out of this Rs 32,000 million was generated in the organised sector. Present this data as a table. What kind of ways should be thought of for generating more employment in the city?

MONEY AND CREDIT
1. In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower. Explain.
Ans:
In high-risk situations, credit can worsen the financial condition of the borrower. For instance, if a farmer takes a loan for crop production and the crops fail due to unforeseen reasons (like droughts or pest attacks), the farmer cannot repay the loan. This leads to a debt trap, where the borrower may have to sell assets, like land, to repay the debt, exacerbating their financial problems .
2. How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants? Explain with an example of your own.
Ans:
Money eliminates the need for a double coincidence of wants by acting as a universally accepted medium of exchange. In a barter system, both parties must want what the other offers, making trade difficult. For example, if a farmer wants shoes but the cobbler does not need wheat, they cannot trade. However, with money, the farmer can sell wheat for money and then use that money to buy shoes from the cobbler .
3. How do banks mediate between those who have surplus money and those who need money?
Ans:
Banks act as intermediaries by accepting deposits from those who have surplus money and providing loans to those in need. They offer interest on deposits to attract savers and charge interest on loans, which allows them to profit from the difference while meeting the needs of both savers and borrowers .
4. Look at a 10 rupee note. What is written on top? Can you explain this statement?
Ans:
On the top of a 10 rupee note, it states: "I promise to pay the bearer the sum of Ten Rupees." This statement signifies that the note is a legal tender issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and is a promise from the government to honor the value printed on it in the form of currency .
5. Why do we need to expand formal sources of credit in India?
Ans:
Expanding formal sources of credit is essential to reduce dependence on informal lenders, who often charge exorbitant interest rates and exploit borrowers. By increasing access to formal loans through banks and cooperatives, especially in rural areas, the cost of credit decreases, leading to improved financial stability and economic growth .
6. What is the basic idea behind the SHGs for the poor? Explain in your own words.
Ans:
The basic idea behind Self-Help Groups (SHGs) is to organize poor households, especially women, into small groups to promote saving and lending among members. The group pools its members' savings and uses the collective fund to provide loans at lower interest rates than informal lenders. Over time, these groups also become eligible for bank loans, further helping the members with their financial needs .
7. What are the reasons why banks might not be willing to lend to certain borrowers?
Ans:
Banks may be reluctant to lend to certain borrowers due to factors such as a lack of collateral, poor credit history, or insufficient documentation. High-risk borrowers, such as those engaged in unpredictable or unstable businesses (e.g., small farmers facing uncertain crop outcomes), may also find it harder to secure loans .
8. In what ways does the Reserve Bank of India supervise the functioning of banks? Why is this necessary?
Ans:
The Reserve Bank of India supervises banks by ensuring they maintain a minimum cash reserve, monitoring their lending practices, and requiring periodic reports on their loan activities. This supervision is necessary to ensure that banks operate safely, provide loans to priority sectors like small farmers and businesses, and maintain financial stability in the economy .
9. Analyse the role of credit for development.
Answer:
Credit plays a vital role in the development of individuals, businesses, and the economy as a whole.
It enables people to invest in education, healthcare, and other essential services.
For businesses, credit allows them to expand, modernize equipment, and manage working capital needs.
For example, a farmer might use credit to purchase seeds and fertilizers, leading to increased agricultural productivity.
However, the positive impact of credit is contingent upon favorable terms and the ability to repay the loan .
10. Manav needs a loan to set up a small business. On what basis will Manav decide whether to borrow from the bank or the moneylender? Discuss.
Answer:
Manav will consider several factors in deciding whether to borrow from a bank or a moneylender:
Interest Rates: Banks generally offer lower interest rates compared to moneylenders, making borrowing cheaper.
Collateral: Banks often require collateral, while moneylenders may provide loans without collateral, albeit at higher interest rates.
Terms of Credit: Manav will evaluate the terms of credit such as the loan amount, repayment period, and flexibility of repayment.
Accessibility: Moneylenders may be more easily accessible, especially in rural areas, whereas formal bank loans might involve more paperwork and longer approval times .
11. In India, about 80 per cent of farmers are small farmers who need credit for cultivation.
a. Why might banks be unwilling to lend to small farmers?
Banks may be reluctant to lend to small farmers due to the lack of collateral, the higher risk of crop failure, and the irregularity of income in agriculture.
b. What are the other sources from which the small farmers can borrow?
Other sources include local moneylenders, traders, relatives, cooperative societies, and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) .
c. Explain with an example of how the terms of credit can be unfavorable for the small farmer.
Small farmers often face high-interest rates from moneylenders, who may also exploit their dependency. For example, Swapna, a farmer who took a loan at high interest, faced crop failure and was forced to sell her land to repay the debt, pushing her deeper into financial distress .
d. Suggest some ways by which small farmers can get cheap credit.
Small farmers can access cheaper credit through government initiatives, increased lending by cooperative societies, and formal banks, or by organizing into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) which provide loans at lower interest rates .

Answer: c. Employers

GLOBALISATION AND THE INDIAN ECONOMY 
1. What do you understand by globalisation? Explain in your own words.
Answer:
Globalisation refers to the rapid integration and interconnection of different countries through the movement of goods, services, technology, and investments across borders. It involves the interaction of businesses and markets on a global scale, enabling countries to engage in international trade, exchange technology, and share cultural aspects .
2. What were the reasons for putting barriers to foreign trade and foreign investment by the Indian government? Why did it wish to remove these barriers?
Answer:
Reasons for barriers: Post-Independence, India imposed barriers to foreign trade and investment to protect domestic producers from foreign competition and promote self-reliance. Only essential items like machinery and petroleum were allowed to be imported.
Reasons to remove barriers: In 1991, the government began to remove these barriers to encourage foreign investment, enhance competitiveness, and promote economic growth. This move helped Indian producers compete in global markets and attracted foreign companies to invest in India .
3. How would flexibility in labour laws help companies?
Answer:
Flexibility in labour laws allows companies to adjust their workforce according to production demands. For example, during peak periods, companies can hire temporary workers, reducing costs associated with permanent employees. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), where companies can avoid some regular labour laws, allowing them to reduce operational costs and hire workers for short durations during high workloads .
4. What are the various ways in which MNCs set up, or control, production in other countries?
Answer:
Multinational Corporations (MNCs) set up production in other countries through:
Establishing factories and offices in locations with cheap labour and resources.
Collaborating with local companies for joint production.
Acquiring local companies to expand their production base.
Distributing different stages of production across countries to minimise costs (e.g., designing in one country, manufacturing in another) .
5. Why do developed countries want developing countries to liberalise their trade and investment? What do you think should the developing countries demand in return?
Answer:
Developed countries want developing nations to liberalise trade and investment to gain access to new markets for their goods and services, as well as cheaper resources and labor. In return, developing countries should demand fairer terms of trade, protection of local industries, and better access to developed markets for their goods. Additionally, developing nations should seek assurances of investments that support long-term development and infrastructure .
6. “The impact of globalisation has not been uniform.” Explain this statement.
Answer:
Globalisation has affected different sections of society in various ways. While some sectors like IT and large corporations have benefited from increased investment and competition, small producers and workers, particularly in unorganised sectors, have faced challenges due to increased competition and job insecurity. The benefits of globalisation have been more favorable to those with skills, education, and capital, leaving others behind .
7. How has liberalisation of trade and investment policies helped the globalisation process?
Answer:
Liberalisation has removed restrictions on trade and investment, allowing businesses to freely import and export goods and services. It has facilitated the entry of multinational corporations into new markets and increased competition, thus accelerating the process of globalisation. This has allowed goods, services, and investments to move across borders more easily .
8. How does foreign trade lead to integration of markets across countries? Explain with an example other than those given here.
Answer:
Foreign trade connects markets by allowing goods and services to be exchanged across borders, leading to price equalization and competition among producers worldwide. For example, the trade of smartphones between countries like China (manufacturing) and the U.S. (consumption) integrates these markets. Buyers in the U.S. have access to cheaper products, and producers in China gain access to a larger market 
9. Globalisation will continue in the future. Can you imagine what the world would be like twenty years from now? Give reasons for your answer.
Answer:
In twenty years, globalization will likely deepen with advances in technology, better communication, and trade expansion. More countries, especially in Asia and Africa, will integrate into global supply chains, boosting their economies. However, inequalities may widen unless fair policies are adopted to distribute the benefits of globalization equitably.

10. Supposing you find two people arguing: One is saying globalisation has hurt our country’s development. The other is telling, globalisation is helping India develop. How would you respond to these arguments?
Answer:
Globalisation has helped India by attracting foreign investment, growing industries like IT and manufacturing. However, it has also hurt small producers and led to job insecurity due to flexible labour practices. Both views are valid: globalisation boosts economic growth but needs fair policies to protect vulnerable workers.

Consumer Rights
1. Why are rules and regulations required in the marketplace? Illustrate with a few examples.
Answer: Rules and regulations in the marketplace are crucial to protect consumers. They prevent sellers from misleading buyers and ensure accountability when issues arise. For instance, if a consumer discovers an expired product after purchase, regulations ensure the shopkeeper must replace or refund it. Without such rules, consumers could face difficulties in seeking remedies for faulty products.
2. What factors gave birth to the consumer movement in India? Trace its evolution.
Answer: The consumer movement in India arose due to several factors:
Lack of legal protection for consumers against marketplace exploitation.
The need to protect consumers from unethical and unfair trade practices.
Issues such as rampant food shortages, black marketing, and adulteration of food and edible oil.
Until the mid-1970s, consumer organizations focused on raising awareness through articles and exhibitions. Since the 1980s, there has been a significant increase in the number of consumer groups in India, now totaling around 700. This growth reflects greater consumer awareness and a shift from a sellers’ market to a buyers’ market.
These movements also influenced the government to take action. The Consumer Protection Act was enacted in 1986 to safeguard consumer interests and ensure fair treatment in the marketplace.
3. Explain the need for consumer consciousness by giving two examples.
Answer: Consumers should stay vigilant to avoid being exploited in the marketplace:
Always check the expiry and manufacturing dates of products before purchase. Report any expired products to the consumer forum for action.
Request a computerized bill for all purchases. This serves as evidence in case of disputes over product authenticity or quality.
These practices empower consumers to protect their rights and ensure fair treatment in transactions.
4. Mention a few factors which cause the exploitation of consumers.
Answer: Factors leading to consumer exploitation include:
Lack of Awareness: Consumers often fail to ask for proper bills, leading to potential exploitation if products are defective.
Inadequate Monitoring of Regulations: Weak enforcement of rules and regulations contributes to exploitation in the marketplace.
Tolerance of Small Losses: Ignoring minor issues without complaint can embolden sellers to continue unfair practices.
Lack of Consumer Consciousness: Checking details like Maximum Retail Price (MRP), expiry, and manufacturing dates before purchase can prevent exploitation.
By being informed and proactive, consumers can protect themselves from exploitation and ensure fair treatment in transactions.
5. What is the rationale behind the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act 1986?
Answer: The Consumer Protection Act 1986 was enacted to establish dedicated departments at both central and state levels to address consumer complaints. Its main goal is to protect consumers from exploitation in the marketplace by providing accessible avenues for resolving grievances through consumer courts.
6. Describe some of your duties as consumers if you visit a shopping complex in your locality.
Answer: Here are some consumer duties simplified:
Always ask for a receipt or bill.
Verify the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) and avoid overpaying.
Check expiry and manufacturing dates before purchase.
Report any violations of marketplace laws to consumer courts.
Address even minor discrepancies to prevent them from recurring for others.
7. Suppose you buy a bottle of honey and a biscuit packet. Which logo or mark you will have to look for and why?
Answer: If you buy a bottle of honey or a packet of biscuits, look for the Agmark and the ISI mark before buying them. It is because these symbols specify that the products have been made by Government authorised companies.
8. What legal measures were taken by the government to empower consumers in India?
Answer: Here are the simplified legal measures taken to empower consumers:
Consumer Protection Act (COPRA): Passed to protect consumers from market exploitation.
Right to Information Act (RTI): Enacted in 2005 to ensure transparency in government functioning.
Consumer Courts: Established to address cases of consumer grievances and disparities.
9. Mention some of the rights of consumers and write a few sentences on each.
Answer: Right to Information: Ensures citizens can access government information under the RTI Act of 2005.
Right to Choose: Allows consumers freedom in purchasing decisions without discrimination based on age, gender, or type of service.
Right to Seek Redressal: Empowers consumers to seek compensation for damages caused by unfair trade practices.
Right to Representation: Grants consumers the right to present their case before consumer courts to address grievances.
10. By what means can the consumers express their solidarity?
Answer: Consumers can express their solidarity by organising themselves in small groups that can fight against exploitative trade policies. Such groups get financial aid from the government to fight the case against the shopkeeper.
11. Critically examine the progress of the consumer movement in India.
Answer: The consumer movement in India has grown significantly in recent years due to government initiatives. The Consumer Protection Act (COPRA) empowers people to file complaints against unfair practices by sellers. This has led to increased awareness among the public and stricter actions against malpractices in the marketplace.
